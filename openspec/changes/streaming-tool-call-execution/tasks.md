# Tasks: Streaming Tool-Call Execution

## Phase A: Streaming contract foundation

- [x] Add a `ToolCallUpdate` type: a non-terminal activity variant (phase label +
  optional output chunk) and a terminal completion variant (result string)
- [x] Add `ExecuteStreamAsync` to `INetclawTool` as a default interface method —
  default body yields one terminal completion item wrapping the existing
  `ExecuteAsync(arguments, context, ct)`
- [x] Add `ExecuteStreamAsync` to `IToolExecutor`; implement in
  `DispatchingToolExecutor` (authorize, resolve, surface the tool's stream,
  redact secrets per item, log)
- [x] Verify build clean (0 warnings); the ~28 `NetclawTool<TParams>` tools and
  `McpToolAdapter` / `AIToolAdapter` compile with no change
- **Acceptance:** a tool that does not override `ExecuteStreamAsync` produces
  exactly one terminal completion item carrying its current result

## Phase B: Per-call streaming watchdog

- [x] Add a two-phase `StreamingToolWatchdog` helper (first-item budget +
  inter-item budget that resets on each item), `TimeProvider`-driven, with no
  Akka or actor dependency
- [x] Switch `SessionToolExecutionPipeline.ExecuteSingleToolAsync` to consume
  `ExecuteStreamAsync` under the per-call watchdog; remove the flat `CancelAfter`
  in `ExecuteToolAttemptAsync`
- [x] On budget expiry: cancel the call's token; yield a terminal error result
  naming the tool and the timeout (keyed to the tool-call id)
- [x] Keep `SessionConfig.ToolExecutionTimeoutSeconds` as the single per-call
  inactivity budget used for both first-item and inter-item phases
- [x] Update `src/Netclaw.Configuration/Schemas/netclaw-config.v1.schema.json`
  with the revised per-call inactivity description
- [x] Verify build; `Task.WhenAll` over independent tool calls still drives
  `ExecuteToolsAsync`
- **Acceptance:** a stalled stream trips the inter-item budget; a slow first
  item trips the first-item budget; a healthy parallel call is unaffected

## Phase C: Revert ProcessingWatchdog to LLM-only

- [x] `LlmSessionActor.HandleToolCallResponse` no longer arms a `ToolExecution`
  operation on `ProcessingWatchdog`
- [x] Remove `ToolExecution`-operation handling, `ProcessingWatchdog.RefreshIfCurrent`,
  and `PauseToolExecutionWatchdogForApprovalWait` /
  `ResumeToolExecutionWatchdogAfterApprovalWait`
- [x] Confirm `ProcessingWatchdog` governs only `LlmCall` and `Compaction`
- [x] Verify build; update/trim watchdog tests that asserted tool-execution
  watchdog behavior
- **Acceptance:** dispatching a tool batch arms no processing-watchdog operation;
  a long tool call does not trip a session-level timeout

## Phase D: spawn_agent as a streaming tool

- [x] `SpawnAgentTool` overrides `ExecuteStreamAsync`; route `SubAgentActor`
  progress into a `Channel<ToolCallUpdate>` consumed as the tool's stream
- [x] `SubAgentSpawner` surfaces the run through an activity channel while still
  awaiting the terminal `SubAgentResult` from the child actor; terminal result
  becomes the completion item
- [x] `SubAgentActor` keeps its own internal inactivity watchdog; remove the
  absolute wall-clock backstop and its timer
- [x] Verify build
- **Acceptance:** a `spawn_agent` call emits activity while the sub-agent works;
  two parallel `spawn_agent` calls with one wedged — the wedged one times out
  independently, the healthy one returns, both tool-result messages reach the LLM

## Phase E: Recursion and approval cleanup

- [x] Collapse sub-agent recursion to the single `SubAgentToolPolicy` denylist in
  `SubAgentSpawner.ResolveTools`; remove the `spawn_agent` string-compare in the
  `SubAgentActor` constructor
- [x] Remove the non-interactive safe-list auto-grant from `ToolAccessPolicy`;
  ensure an unapproved tool in a non-interactive session fails closed with a
  legible error naming the tool and the reason
- [x] Verify build
- **Acceptance:** `spawn_agent` is absent from any resolved sub-agent tool set; a
  non-interactive sub-agent calling an unapproved tool fails with a legible error

## Phase F: Opt-in streaming tools

- [ ] `ShellTool` overrides `ExecuteStreamAsync` to emit stdout/stderr as activity
  items; the terminal item carries the assembled, clamped result (replaces
  buffer-everything-then-truncate)
- [ ] `WebFetchTool` overrides `ExecuteStreamAsync` to emit fetch-progress
  activity items (optional within this change)
- **Acceptance:** streamed shell output appears as activity items only; the LLM
  still receives one clamped terminal result per call

## Phase G: Tests, docs, eval

- [x] Unit tests for `StreamingToolWatchdog` with `FakeTimeProvider` —
  deterministic, no `Task.Delay` (per `CLAUDE.md` testing rules)
- [x] Regression test: a non-streaming tool yields exactly one terminal item
- [ ] Integration test: two concurrent `spawn_agent` calls, one wedged — wedged
  one caught independently, healthy result + timeout error both reach the LLM
- [x] Integration test: mixed batch `[healthy tool, hung tool]` — the hung tool is
  still caught; no whole-batch failure
- [x] Update `docs/runbooks/subagents.md` and any tool-timeout operator guidance
- [x] Update the affected system skill guidance if tool/sub-agent guidance
  changed (System Skills Sync Rule)
- [x] `dotnet slopwatch analyze` — no new violations; `./scripts/Add-FileHeaders.ps1 -Verify`
- [ ] Run `./evals/run-evals.sh` (tool surface + `SessionConfig` changed)
- **Acceptance:** full `Netclaw.Actors.Tests` / `Netclaw.Configuration.Tests`
  suites pass; eval suite passes; manual repro confirms a heavy `spawn_agent` no
  longer dies mid-stream and parallel spawns with one wedged do not hang the turn

## Phase H: Liveness consolidation (#1472 / PR #1481)

- [x] Opaque tools bounded by one wall-clock budget; drop the inter-item reset
- [x] Self-monitoring tools drained with no parent watchdog (`DrainToCompletionAsync`);
  remove the `FirstItemOnly` startup-guard budget
- [x] `ToolLivenessValidator` startup assertion — declared vs resolved liveness must
  match in BOTH directions, else fail loud
- [x] Delete the `SuspendsInactivityWatchdog` flag (no parent watchdog left to pause)
- [x] Caller cancellation of a self-monitoring drain surfaces as a failed batch, not a
  tool-result error fed to the model
- [x] Tests: self-monitoring runs-to-completion + bounded-only-by-caller-cancellation;
  liveness-validator both directions
- [ ] Re-run `./evals/run-evals.sh` (Subagents category) on the consolidated build
- **Acceptance:** a self-monitoring tool is never killed by a parent timer; opaque
  tools still time out at their wall-clock budget; the subagent eval passes
