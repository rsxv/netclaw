## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: TA-9 Agent correction precedes a prompt and grants no authority

Agent correction SHALL run only after admission, hard deny, protected-path, and
shell analysis checks pass. It SHALL return `RequiresAgentCorrection` with one
or more typed corrections and SHALL NOT run the tool, show a prompt, or create
a grant. The model's replacement call SHALL start a new authorization attempt
and pass every check again.

- A shell call that runs one exact native-tool executable SHALL receive a
  native-tool correction before stored grants.
- A Personal call, attended or unattended, that authors a write under the
  platform temporary root SHALL receive a managed temporary directory
  correction when the ordinary result would ask for consent. Team and Public SHALL NOT receive
  the managed path.
- An exact leading Bash directory change for project work SHALL receive a
  one-call working-directory correction that does not rewrite the command.
- Corrections SHALL precede an `Auto` allow. Temporary advice SHALL keep
  stored-grant and one-time precedence.
- A repeated equivalent call after a managed temporary correction SHALL
  suppress the correction once and SHALL offer only `Once` and `Deny`.
- The parent session and a subagent SHALL use the same corrections.

#### Scenario: Temporary write gets a correction, not a prompt

- **GIVEN** an interactive Personal session
- **WHEN** the model calls `file_write` on a path under the platform temporary root
- **THEN** authorization returns `RequiresAgentCorrection` with a managed temporary directory correction
- **AND** no prompt is shown

#### Scenario: Hard deny wins over a correction

- **GIVEN** an interactive Personal session
- **WHEN** the model calls `shell_execute` with a hard-denied command that also writes under the temporary root
- **THEN** authorization returns `Denied`

#### Scenario: Retry after a correction asks with one-time options only

- **GIVEN** an armed managed temporary correction for an exact call
- **WHEN** the model repeats the same call
- **THEN** authorization returns `RequiresApproval`
- **AND** the prompt offers only `Once` and `Deny`

#### Scenario: A reviewed phrase in a readable folder gets no project correction

- **GIVEN** a Personal session, attended or unattended, with no grants
- **AND** the shell folder is readable by the audience but is not the declared project directory
- **WHEN** the model calls `shell_execute` with a reviewed phrase, for example `git status`, in that folder
- **THEN** authorization returns `Allowed` through reviewed-safe coverage
- **AND** the result has no correction that asks for `set_working_directory`
