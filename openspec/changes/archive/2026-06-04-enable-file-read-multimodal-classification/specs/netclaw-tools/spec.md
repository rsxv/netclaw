## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: File read tool

The system SHALL provide a `file_read` first-party tool that authorizes the
requested path through the audience-scoped read-file policy before inspecting or
reading bytes. Text-like files SHALL return decoded text for UTF-8, UTF-16/UTF-32
Unicode, and common Windows-1252 text files using the existing offset/limit and
output-truncation behavior.

For non-text files, `file_read` SHALL NOT return raw binary content. It SHALL
detect the file category using the canonical attachment taxonomy where possible
and return structured metadata plus an explicit next-step message.

Images SHALL be eligible for model-visible handoff only when the active model's
input modalities include image support. The handoff SHALL use session media
references and the existing `DataContent` rehydration path, not binary content in
the tool-result string. Streaming tool-result persistence SHALL retain the media
references needed to recreate the handoff nudge during recovery.

PDF extraction, OCR, audio transcription, and video keyframe extraction SHALL NOT
be built into `file_read`.

#### Scenario: Text file read preserves existing behavior

- **GIVEN** a readable text file using UTF-8, UTF-16/UTF-32 Unicode, or Windows-1252
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `file_read` with optional offset and limit values
- **THEN** the tool returns text content with the existing line pagination and
  truncation behavior

#### Scenario: Image read on image-capable model becomes model-visible

- **GIVEN** a readable PNG file
- **AND** the active model supports image input
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `file_read`
- **THEN** the tool returns metadata indicating the image was loaded for visual
  inspection
- **AND** the next LLM call includes the image through a session media reference

#### Scenario: Sub-agent image read can become model-visible

- **GIVEN** a sub-agent uses `file_read` on a readable PNG file
- **AND** the sub-agent's selected model supports image input
- **WHEN** the tool result is returned to the sub-agent loop
- **THEN** the next sub-agent LLM call includes the image through a session media
  reference

#### Scenario: Image read on text-only model returns modality guidance

- **GIVEN** a readable PNG file
- **AND** the active model does not support image input
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `file_read`
- **THEN** the tool returns metadata and the canonical image modality-gap note
- **AND** no media reference is added to the next LLM call

#### Scenario: PDF read does not extract text

- **GIVEN** a readable PDF file
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `file_read`
- **THEN** the tool returns metadata identifying the file as a PDF
- **AND** the result says native PDF extraction is not built into `file_read`
- **AND** no raw PDF bytes are returned

#### Scenario: Unsupported binary read returns explicit guidance

- **GIVEN** a readable archive, audio file, video file, binary document, or
  unknown binary file
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `file_read`
- **THEN** the tool returns metadata and explicit unsupported-format guidance
- **AND** no raw bytes are returned
