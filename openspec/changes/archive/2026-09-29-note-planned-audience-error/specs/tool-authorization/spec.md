## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: TA-1 Trust context is explicit and fails loud

Every session turn SHALL carry an explicit turn context with a parsed audience
(`Personal`, `Team`, or `Public`), a requester, and a principal. Authorization,
consent, and dispatch SHALL use this turn context. The session journal SHALL
persist the turn context with each consent request, and a recovered request
SHALL use the persisted context, not the current session state.

An ingress that receives an invalid audience value SHALL reject the input
loudly (for example an HTTP 400 result or a CLI exit code 1). Where a
component falls back because an audience is missing or cannot be parsed, it
SHALL fall back to the narrowest audience, `Public`. No fallback SHALL select
a broader audience than the source provides. An audience derived from a
deployment default and a source audience SHALL be the narrower of the two.

Planned change (owner decision, September 29): a missing or unreadable
audience becomes an error in every component. A follow-up code PR implements
it. Until that PR merges, the `Public` fallback above is the current behavior.

A turn without a message source SHALL NOT synthesize a requester. A consent
request without a recorded requester SHALL fail closed without a prompt,
except for a verified-automation principal.

#### Scenario: Invalid audience is rejected at ingress

- **GIVEN** a reminder create request with audience `admin`
- **WHEN** the daemon endpoint validates the request
- **THEN** it returns HTTP 400
- **AND** it dispatches no command

#### Scenario: Missing source audience does not broaden

- **GIVEN** a deployment default of `Personal` and a source audience of `Team`
- **WHEN** Netclaw derives the effective audience
- **THEN** the effective audience is `Team`

#### Scenario: Turn without a source cannot ask for consent

- **GIVEN** a turn with no message source
- **WHEN** a tool call requires consent
- **THEN** the call fails closed without a prompt
- **AND** Netclaw does not create a requester
