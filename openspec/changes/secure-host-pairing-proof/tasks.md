## 1. Planning and Shared Contract

- [x] 1.1 Add the approved security task to `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and verify its PRD and OpenSpec links.
- [x] 1.2 Add the local-control proof term to the glossary and validate all OpenSpec artifacts.
- [x] 1.3 Add the shared Data Protection proof codec and verify binary layout, purpose isolation, and key-ring failures.

## 2. Daemon Security Path

- [x] 2.1 Add the bounded proof validator and verify time, operation, version, replay, and capacity decisions with virtual time.
- [x] 2.2 Add the local-control HTTP endpoint and verify every denial creates no pairing code.
- [x] 2.3 Remove hub code generation and verify the hub keeps only its authenticated chat functions.

## 3. Pairing State Integrity

- [x] 3.1 Add one pairing coordinator and verify code generation and exchange use the same serialized state boundary.
- [x] 3.2 Preserve a valid code after duplicate-name and registry failures, then verify a later unique-name exchange succeeds.
- [x] 3.3 Verify concurrent use permits one device registration and one code consumption.

## 4. CLI and Compatibility

- [x] 4.1 Replace the CLI SignalR call with the local-control endpoint and verify clear mixed-version errors.
- [x] 4.2 Verify a host without a device token can create a code in every exposure mode.
- [x] 4.3 Verify the container procedure uses the CLI inside the daemon container with the shared Netclaw home.

## 5. Regression Proof and Operations

- [x] 5.1 Add and approve the complete pairing security matrix snapshot.
- [x] 5.2 Extend the deterministic pairing smoke scenario and verify host success, remote denial, restart state, and duplicate-name retry.
- [x] 5.3 Update the operations skill and record the vague website procedure task for the next `0.27` beta.
- [x] 5.4 Run focused tests, the full suite, evals, Slopwatch, header checks, OpenSpec validation, and `git diff --check`.

## 6. Adversarial Review Follow-up

- [x] 6.1 Use a dedicated host client that ignores remote client state, bearer tokens, HTTP proxies, and redirects.
- [x] 6.2 Verify the proof never reaches a remote endpoint, redirect target, or HTTP proxy.
- [x] 6.3 Restrict pairing-code mutation to the coordinator and expire replay entries with their proof windows.
- [x] 6.4 Bound local-control request load and verify key-ring first use and corruption failures.

## 7. Pull Request Review Follow-up

- [x] 7.1 Clarify credential lifetimes, recovery steps, glossary terms, and the forwarded-loopback boundary.
- [x] 7.2 Add status-specific pairing CLI guidance and tests that prove failures do not persist credentials.
- [x] 7.3 Update the operations guide and public delivery text.
- [x] 7.4 Run all required checks and answer the pull request review threads.

## 8. Exposure-Mode Review Clarification

- [x] 8.1 Document the two pairing paths and the authority matrix for every exposure mode.
- [x] 8.2 Add positive and negative reverse-proxy examples, including the copied-proof transport limit.
- [x] 8.3 Sync the main specifications and rerun strict OpenSpec validation.
- [x] 8.4 Add direct regression tests for non-loopback host access and forwarded-loopback denial.

## 9. Final Adversarial Review Fixes

- [x] 9.1 Reserve a valid pairing code before the registry write and consume that reservation after the write.
- [x] 9.2 Reject proof replay at the exact proof-lifetime boundary with deterministic virtual-time tests.
- [x] 9.3 Require HTTPS for remote exchange, reject redirects, bound error bodies, and handle invalid remote responses.
- [x] 9.4 Remove invalid exchange-result states, use `Task` for I/O, and report the actual failed host endpoint.
- [x] 9.5 Sync the main specs and rerun tests, evals, Slopwatch, headers, strict validation, and CRAP analysis.

## 10. Recovery and Protocol Review Corrections

- [x] 10.1 Preserve the prior registry and cache after a failed write; prove reopen, token use, and retry.
- [x] 10.2 Bound success and error responses before body allocation; prove byte limits and cancellation after headers.
- [x] 10.3 Assert fixed protocol vectors and malformed payload rejection independently of a codec round trip.
- [x] 10.4 Separate both mixed-version scenarios and sync the main specifications without a compatibility stub.
- [x] 10.5 Run regression checks, process smoke, quality gates, and independent verification; record evidence and limits.

Local tests pass: Configuration 634, Daemon 1,121, and CLI 1,495.
The daemon suite also has one existing Windows-only skip on Linux.
The native pairing scenario passes all eight checks.
The independent review accepts all four corrections.
Slopwatch, header verification, and strict OpenSpec validation pass.
The codec mutation check fails five cases when both timestamp methods use little-endian bytes.
The user excluded model evals from these corrections because they affect transport, persistence, and protocol bytes rather than model behavior.
The completed deterministic checks establish the required local proof. Fresh CI remains a separate merge gate.

## 11. Actor-Owned Pairing Transaction

- [x] 11.1 Replace the coordinator and code service with one actor and remove their locks and reservation type.
- [x] 11.2 Route the real HTTP endpoints through the registered actor without changing authority checks or HTTP contracts.
- [x] 11.3 Prove transaction order, expiry, cancellation, write-failure recovery, and actor restart with deterministic actor tests.
- [x] 11.4 Keep capability specs behavioral; record actor details in the design notes and update the glossary code anchor.
- [x] 11.5 Run the affected suites, native process smoke, quality checks, and independent review without model evals.

The local actor refactor passes 634 configuration tests, 1,122 daemon tests, and 1,495 CLI tests.
One Windows-only daemon test is skipped on Linux.
The native process scenario passes eight checks.
The focused coverage run passes all 134 security tests.
Slopwatch, header verification, and strict OpenSpec validation pass.
The independent source review finds no remaining code blocker.
The capability specs define behavior; the design notes contain actor details.
Fresh remote CI remains a separate merge gate. Model evals remain outside this scope.
