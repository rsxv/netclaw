## Why

PRD-001 and PRD-006 require reliable long agent turns and factual tool results.

The current iteration cap stops all long turns, but it does not stop an active tool cycle early.

## What Changes

- Add a bounded detector for exact action-and-outcome cycles with periods one through three.
- Block the next batch before execution after two complete copies of a cycle.
- Return one paired correction result for the first blocked batch.
- Force a text-only response when the model repeats the blocked batch.
- Reset detector state for a new user turn, but preserve it across normal compaction.
- Preserve loaded deferred schemas across successful normal compaction.
- Evict loaded schemas after recovery or an LLM failure, including context overflow.
- Give an MCP tool-declared error a non-success receipt without parsing its text.
- Use the same detector contract for parent and child actors.
- Keep the parent and child iteration limits as rollout guards until replay evidence passes.
- Remove both iteration limits only after the staged acceptance gates pass.
- Add aggregate diagnostics that contain the cycle period, repetition count, and decision.
- Keep arguments, results, identifiers, session data, and hashes out of logs.

In scope:

- Exact comparison of canonical execution arguments and exact model-visible results.
- Complete parallel batches, cancellation, approval redrive, compaction, and call-result pair integrity.
- A disposable standalone detector laboratory and sanitized fixtures before runtime integration.
- Observe-only rollout before the correction and final-stop stages.

Out of scope:

- A semantic progress score, embeddings, or an LLM judge.
- Provider-specific decoder changes or model-family settings.
- Durable detector state or cross-turn penalties.
- Tool-specific command grammar or arbitrary result normalization.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

None.

### Modified Capabilities

- `turn-loop-governance`: Detect exact completed cycles and define correction, stop, reset, and rollout behavior.
- `progressive-tool-disclosure`: Preserve loaded schemas across normal compaction and evict them after failures or recovery.
- `netclaw-tools`: Classify tool-declared MCP failures and preserve paired synthetic correction results.
- `netclaw-subagents`: Apply the same cycle contract and staged limit removal to child runs.

## Impact

The change affects `TurnStateTracker`, both actor tool loops, tool-call preparation, result receipts, and compaction state transitions.

The change adds no package, provider, actor, persistence event, or configuration property.

An adjacent diagnostic repair adds two phase flags to the existing compaction transport DTO.
The flags preserve actor evidence through the daemon-to-CLI JSON boundary.

The detector state is actor-local and bounded to six completed iterations.

The correction grants no authority and causes no requested side effect.

Operators receive aggregate cycle decisions without sensitive payloads.
