# netclaw-onboarding Specification

## Purpose

Define bootstrap-first, first-run, and resumable onboarding experiences for
Netclaw operators, including identity-file behavior and existing-install
branches.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Stepwise setup wizard

The system SHALL guide operators through setup steps with validation at each
step.

#### Scenario: Step progression

- **WHEN** operator completes a step successfully
- **THEN** onboarding advances to the next step

### Requirement: Secret-safe input handling

The system SHALL avoid echoing sensitive credentials in plain text output.

#### Scenario: Entering provider key

- **WHEN** operator enters a provider API key
- **THEN** the input is masked and not logged in clear text

### Requirement: Security warnings for internet-reachable modes

The system SHALL show explicit warnings before enabling internet-reachable
exposure modes. `Public` deployment posture remains a channel-audience term,
not an anonymous network-access term. Audience selection and exposure-mode
selection are independent choices: audience controls chat participants, while
exposure mode controls daemon network reachability.

#### Scenario: Enable funnel mode

- **WHEN** operator selects `tailscale-funnel`
- **THEN** onboarding requires explicit confirmation and validation that remote
  access is restricted to authenticated users

### Requirement: Guided onboarding

`netclaw init` SHALL provide bootstrap-first guided setup. The flow SHALL
collect provider configuration, identity, and security posture. Security
Posture, Enabled Features, and Audience Profiles are distinct concepts.

If the operator selects `Personal`, the bootstrap flow SHALL skip Enabled
Features.

If the operator selects `Team` or `Public`, the bootstrap flow SHALL
automatically continue into Enabled Features before final write.

Audience Profiles editing SHALL NOT be part of init bootstrap; it belongs
to `netclaw config`.

The wizard SHALL continue to write `SOUL.md` and `TOOLING.md`. Identity
remains init-owned in this branch.

The bootstrap wizard SHALL consist of exactly **5 steps** in canonical order:
Provider → Identity → Security Posture → Enabled Features → Health Check.
`TotalSteps` is **5** for `Team`/`Public` postures and **4** for `Personal`
posture (Enabled Features is omitted). Step-progress indicators SHALL reflect
the dynamic count.

#### Scenario: Personal posture skips enabled-features bootstrap step

- **GIVEN** the operator selected `Personal`
- **WHEN** the posture step completes
- **THEN** init does not open an Enabled Features step
- **AND** the wizard proceeds directly to Health Check (step 4 of 4)

#### Scenario: Team posture continues into enabled-features bootstrap step

- **GIVEN** the operator selected `Team`
- **WHEN** the posture step completes
- **THEN** init automatically continues into Enabled Features

#### Scenario: Public posture continues into enabled-features bootstrap step

- **GIVEN** the operator selected `Public`
- **WHEN** the posture step completes
- **THEN** init automatically continues into Enabled Features

---

### Requirement: Phase 2 conversational personality bootstrap

The system SHALL trigger conversational identity and mission bootstrap through the initial chat message injected by the init wizard's navigate callback when `LaunchChat()` fires. The message SHALL ask naturally about the operator's communication preferences and working style as well as the deployment mission, successful outcomes, recurring workflows, skill-selection expectations, delegation rules, and known quality failures. It SHALL direct the agent to separate operator/personality context into `SOUL.md` and durable mission/workflow guidance into `AGENTS.md`, propose a concise playbook, obtain operator confirmation, then read and update both files. `TOOLING.md` remains wizard-generated.

#### Scenario: First conversation triggers identity and mission discovery

- **GIVEN** the operator completed the init wizard successfully
- **WHEN** the health check step launches chat via `LaunchChat()`
- **THEN** the agent receives a pre-filled onboarding trigger
- **AND** the trigger asks about both operator context and the deployment's mission, workflows, and failure modes

#### Scenario: Bootstrap writes canonical identity files

- **GIVEN** the onboarding conversation is complete and the operator confirmed the proposed playbook
- **WHEN** the agent persists the results
- **THEN** it reads and updates `SOUL.md` with operator and personality context
- **AND** reads and updates `AGENTS.md` with mission and operating workflow guidance
- **AND** reports that the playbook applies on the next inbound turn

#### Scenario: Wizard preserves an existing mission playbook

- **GIVEN** `AGENTS.md` already contains an operator-authored playbook
- **WHEN** the operator completes init or identity redo
- **THEN** wizard file generation does not overwrite the playbook
- **AND** the conversational trigger instructs the agent to read existing content before proposing changes

### Requirement: Environment discovery during onboarding

`netclaw init` SHALL NOT perform environment discovery in the shipped first-run flow (DEFERRED — unimplemented Phase 2 work).

**[DEFERRED — not part of the shipped first-run flow.]** This requirement
describes planned Phase 2 behavior that has not been implemented. Environment
discovery does NOT run during `netclaw init` and is NOT triggered by the health
check step. When implemented, it SHALL be gated by an explicit PRD update and
SHALL NOT be silently enabled in the bootstrap wizard.

The system SHALL scan for installed tools and host capabilities as part of Phase
2 onboarding. Discovery results SHALL be persisted to the environment inventory
file for use in session context and capability self-awareness.

#### Scenario: Tool discovery during onboarding

- **WHEN** Phase 2 onboarding runs environment discovery
- **THEN** the system scans for installed tools (git, gh, claude, opencode,
  dotnet, node)
- **AND** checks git credential status
- **AND** writes results to the environment inventory file

#### Scenario: MCP server reachability check during onboarding

- **GIVEN** MCP servers are configured
- **WHEN** Phase 2 onboarding runs environment discovery
- **THEN** the system checks reachability of each configured MCP server
- **AND** records reachability status in the environment inventory

---

### Requirement: Project registration during onboarding

`netclaw init` SHALL NOT perform project registration in the shipped first-run flow (DEFERRED — unimplemented Phase 2 work).

**[DEFERRED — not part of the shipped first-run flow.]** This requirement
describes planned Phase 2 behavior that has not been implemented. Project
registration does NOT occur during `netclaw init`. When implemented, it SHALL
be gated by an explicit PRD update.

The system SHALL ask the operator about repositories to register as part of
Phase 2 onboarding. Registered projects are added to the project registry
with their paths, capabilities, and AGENTS.md locations.

#### Scenario: Register projects during onboarding

- **WHEN** Phase 2 onboarding reaches the project registration step
- **THEN** the system asks the operator about repositories to register
- **AND** scans provided paths for AGENTS.md files

#### Scenario: Skip project registration

- **WHEN** Phase 2 onboarding reaches the project registration step
- **AND** the operator indicates no projects to register
- **THEN** onboarding proceeds with an empty project registry

---

### Requirement: Memorizer connectivity validation during onboarding

After collecting Memorizer connection details, the wizard SHALL probe the
configured endpoint to validate connectivity. The probe SHALL use a 10-second
timeout. On failure, the wizard SHALL offer retry or fallback to local files.

#### Scenario: Successful connectivity probe

- **GIVEN** the operator entered Memorizer connection details
- **WHEN** the wizard probes the endpoint
- **AND** the endpoint responds within 10 seconds
- **THEN** the wizard shows a success message
- **AND** advances to the next step

#### Scenario: Failed connectivity probe with retry

- **GIVEN** the operator entered Memorizer connection details
- **WHEN** the wizard probes the endpoint
- **AND** the endpoint does not respond within 10 seconds
- **THEN** the wizard shows the error
- **AND** offers "Retry" or "Fall back to local files"

#### Scenario: Fallback to local files after probe failure

- **GIVEN** the Memorizer connectivity probe failed
- **WHEN** the operator selects "Fall back to local files"
- **THEN** the wizard sets `Memory.Provider` to `"files"`
- **AND** removes the `McpServers.memorizer` entry
- **AND** advances to the next step

### Requirement: TUI wizard delivery mechanism

The `netclaw init` onboarding wizard SHALL be delivered through Termina TUI
as an interactive wizard with progress indication, validation, and
back-navigation. The wizard SHALL have **5 steps** for `Team`/`Public` posture
and **4 steps** for `Personal` posture. Step-progress indicators (e.g.,
"Step 2 of 5" or "Step 2 of 4") SHALL reflect the dynamic total. There is no
fixed 9-step wizard.

#### Scenario: Wizard renders in TUI

- **WHEN** operator runs `netclaw init`
- **THEN** a Termina TUI application launches
- **AND** the wizard displays step progress (e.g., "Step 2 of 5")
- **AND** the wizard displays a progress bar

#### Scenario: Step-specific components rendered

- **GIVEN** the wizard is on a step requiring text input
- **WHEN** the step is displayed
- **THEN** the wizard renders TextInputNode components for text/secret fields
- **AND** renders SelectionListNode components for choice fields

#### Scenario: Back navigation between steps

- **GIVEN** the wizard is on step 3
- **WHEN** the operator presses Esc
- **THEN** the wizard navigates back to step 2
- **AND** previous input values are preserved

#### Scenario: Live validation during wizard

- **GIVEN** the wizard is on the Provider step
- **WHEN** the operator enters provider credentials
- **THEN** the wizard validates the credentials
- **AND** displays success or failure before allowing progression

---

### Requirement: Onboarding bootstrap aligns with daemon-owned first-launch bootstrap

The init wizard SHALL remain compatible with daemon-owned first-launch bootstrap seeding. Wizard-written bootstrap state SHALL NOT be required for first-launch success, and wizard finalization SHALL NOT overwrite an existing daemon-owned bootstrap credential.

#### Scenario: Wizardless first boot still succeeds

- **GIVEN** the operator never ran `netclaw init`
- **AND** daemon config is otherwise valid for a remote-auth-required exposure mode
- **WHEN** the daemon starts for the first time
- **THEN** first-launch bootstrap behavior does not depend on wizard-written device state

#### Scenario: Wizard bootstrap does not overwrite existing daemon-owned state

- **GIVEN** the daemon already seeded a bootstrap paired device/token
- **WHEN** the operator later runs `netclaw init`
- **THEN** wizard finalization does not overwrite the existing bootstrap credential automatically

### Requirement: Existing-install init menu

When `netclaw init` runs on an existing install, it SHALL open an action menu
with exactly these options:

- `Redo identity setup`
- `Open configuration editor`
- `Start over from scratch`
- `Cancel`

#### Scenario: Existing install opens action menu

- **GIVEN** `netclaw.json` exists
- **WHEN** the operator runs `netclaw init`
- **THEN** init opens the existing-install menu with the documented four
  options

#### Scenario: Existing install routes to config editor

- **GIVEN** the existing-install menu is open
- **WHEN** the operator chooses `Open configuration editor`
- **THEN** control routes to `netclaw config`

#### Scenario: Existing install routes to init-owned identity flow

- **GIVEN** the existing-install menu is open
- **WHEN** the operator chooses `Redo identity setup`
- **THEN** control routes to the init-owned identity flow

### Requirement: Start-over flow is double-confirmed

Choosing `Start over from scratch` SHALL open a second dialog with exactly:

- `Reset setup only`
- `Full reset`
- `Cancel`

Either destructive option SHALL require double confirmation before files are
mutated.

#### Scenario: Start-over dialog presents reset choices

- **GIVEN** the existing-install menu is open
- **WHEN** the operator chooses `Start over from scratch`
- **THEN** the second dialog presents `Reset setup only`, `Full reset`, and
  `Cancel`

#### Scenario: Destructive reset requires double confirmation

- **GIVEN** the operator selected either `Reset setup only` or `Full reset`
- **WHEN** the destructive flow proceeds
- **THEN** two distinct confirmations are required before mutation

### Requirement: No init-force flag in this flow

This bootstrap flow SHALL NOT rely on a `netclaw init --force` mode.
Existing-install reset behavior SHALL be owned by the in-TUI existing-install
menu and start-over dialogs.

#### Scenario: Existing-install reset does not require hidden flag

- **GIVEN** an existing install
- **WHEN** the operator wants to restart setup
- **THEN** the path is available from the existing-install init menu
- **AND** it does not depend on `netclaw init --force`

### Requirement: Init-owned editor re-entry uses existing config state

Init-owned editor re-entry on an existing install SHALL load existing config
into `WizardContext.ExistingConfig` and prefill non-secret values from that
state. Secret-bearing fields SHALL remain masked and empty.

#### Scenario: Provider re-entry keeps credential field masked

- **GIVEN** an existing provider configuration with stored credentials
- **WHEN** an init-owned provider flow re-enters
- **THEN** provider choice and non-secret fields are prefilled
- **AND** credential inputs remain blank with configured/not-set hint text

#### Scenario: Identity re-entry prefills init-owned fields

- **GIVEN** an existing install with agent name, operator name, and
  timezone already set
- **WHEN** an init-owned identity flow re-enters
- **THEN** those non-secret fields are prefilled

### Requirement: Init-owned writes use semantic merge

Init-owned editor flows SHALL write changes through semantic merge-on-save.
Unrelated config meaning and unrelated stored secrets SHALL be preserved even
if the serialized file text changes.

#### Scenario: Identity-only edit preserves unrelated config meaning

- **GIVEN** an existing install with configured channels, search, and
  exposure settings
- **WHEN** an init-owned identity flow updates only identity-owned data
- **THEN** the unrelated config sections remain semantically unchanged

#### Scenario: Blank secret submission preserves existing secret

- **GIVEN** an init-owned flow includes a secret-bearing field with an
  existing stored value
- **WHEN** the operator leaves that field blank and saves
- **THEN** the existing secret remains stored
- **AND** no decrypted value is shown in the UI

### Requirement: Identity step collects exactly four substeps

The Identity wizard step SHALL collect exactly **4 substeps** in order:
agent name → communication style → operator name → timezone. `SubStepCount`
SHALL equal 4. The Identity step SHALL NOT collect a workspaces directory path
or a notification-webhook URL; those are post-install settings owned by
`netclaw config`.

#### Scenario: Identity step has four substeps

- **WHEN** the wizard enters the Identity step
- **THEN** `SubStepCount` equals 4
- **AND** the substeps are agent name (0), communication style (1), operator
  name (2), and timezone (3)

#### Scenario: Workspaces directory not collected in init

- **WHEN** the operator completes the Identity step
- **THEN** no workspaces directory is written to `netclaw.json`
- **AND** `WizardConfigBuilder.Workspaces` is null after `ContributeConfig`

#### Scenario: Notification webhook not collected in init

- **WHEN** the operator completes the Identity step
- **THEN** no notification webhook is written to `netclaw.json`
- **AND** `WizardConfigBuilder.Notifications` is null after `ContributeConfig`

#### Scenario: Identity step prefills from existing config on re-entry

- **GIVEN** `netclaw.json` exists with `Identity.AgentName`, `Identity.CommunicationStyle`,
  `Identity.UserName`, and `Identity.UserTimezone`
- **WHEN** the operator re-enters the Identity step
- **THEN** all four non-secret fields are prefilled from the existing config

---

### Requirement: Health check auto-launches chat on success

The health check step SHALL launch `netclaw chat` automatically on a clean bootstrap.

On a clean bootstrap (all health check probes passing), the health check step
SHALL invoke `LaunchChat()` automatically without requiring a second Enter
keypress. `LaunchChat()` SHALL route to `/chat` via the wired `Navigate`
delegate. On warnings or failure the step SHALL remain on the summary and exit
on Enter without routing to chat.

#### Scenario: Clean bootstrap auto-launches chat

- **GIVEN** all health-check probes passed
- **WHEN** `RunHealthCheckCoreAsync` completes
- **THEN** `LaunchChat()` is called automatically
- **AND** the Navigate delegate receives `"/chat"`
- **AND** `Succeeded` is `true`

#### Scenario: Failed health check does not launch chat

- **GIVEN** one or more health-check probes failed
- **WHEN** `RunHealthCheckCoreAsync` completes
- **THEN** `LaunchChat()` is NOT called
- **AND** the step displays the failure summary
- **AND** `Succeeded` is `false`

#### Scenario: Failure summary status message

- **GIVEN** the health check completed with at least one failure
- **WHEN** the operator views the summary
- **THEN** the status message reads: "Setup complete with warnings. Run
  `netclaw daemon start`, then `netclaw chat`. Adjust settings with
  `netclaw config`."

---

### Requirement: Health check surfaces container-supervisor deferral reason on timeout

A health-check failure SHALL surface the container-supervisor deferral reason when the supervised daemon never arrives.

When the daemon is externally supervised (`NETCLAW_CONTAINER_SUPERVISOR` marker
set) but the supervisor never actually brings the daemon up within the readiness
poll window, the health-check failure item SHALL surface the actionable
container-supervisor deferral reason (including the hint that the marker may be
set without a supervisor present) rather than the generic "Daemon did not become
ready" message. When a startup-abort crash log is present, the failure message
SHALL include both the abort reason and the crash-log path.

#### Scenario: Supervisor marker set but daemon never starts — surfaces deferral reason

- **GIVEN** `NETCLAW_CONTAINER_SUPERVISOR` is set (i.e., `IsExternallySupervised` is `true`)
- **AND** no supervisor process actually starts the daemon (e.g., the image replaced
  the entrypoint)
- **AND** no `DaemonApi` is wired (poll loop is skipped)
- **WHEN** `StartIfNeededAndPollAsync` times out
- **THEN** the failing health-check item label contains "container supervisor"
- **AND** contains "marker may be set without a supervisor present"
- **AND** does NOT contain "Daemon did not become ready"
- **AND** `Succeeded` is `false`

#### Scenario: Startup-abort crash log surfaces specific failure message

- **GIVEN** the daemon binary exits immediately (bad config or fatal startup error)
- **AND** a crash log exists in the logs directory containing
  "Daemon startup aborted: …"
- **WHEN** `StartIfNeededAndPollAsync` detects the crash log
- **THEN** the failing health-check item label contains the specific abort reason
- **AND** contains the crash-log path
- **AND** does NOT contain "Daemon did not become ready"

#### Scenario: Generic not-ready message is suppressed when a diagnostic is available

- **GIVEN** either a crash log or a supervisor deferral reason is available
- **WHEN** the health-check step records the failure item
- **THEN** the generic "Daemon did not become ready" string is absent from the
  failure label

### Requirement: Missing provider configuration does not fail daemon startup

The daemon SHALL start successfully in degraded mode when no valid inference
provider/model configuration is present, serving No-Op chat responses (see
`netclaw-model-providers`). The onboarding wizard's health-check step SHALL
treat this degraded state as a **warn**-level health-check item with
actionable remediation guidance, distinct from a hard startup failure such
as exposure-mode validation rejection.

#### Scenario: Wizard health-check on fresh install with no provider configured

- **GIVEN** the operator runs `netclaw init` and skips provider configuration,
  OR the operator runs the daemon without ever completing onboarding
- **WHEN** the wizard's health-check step starts the daemon
- **THEN** the daemon SHALL come up successfully
- **AND** the wizard SHALL show a **warn**-level health-check item indicating
  no valid provider/model is configured
- **AND** the warn item SHALL include remediation guidance referencing
  `netclaw model` and editing `netclaw.json`
- **AND** the warn item SHALL NOT be presented as a startup failure

#### Scenario: Wizard distinguishes "no provider configured" from exposure-mode failure

- **GIVEN** the daemon starts in degraded mode because no provider is configured
- **WHEN** the wizard reports health-check results
- **THEN** the "no provider configured" item SHALL appear as **warn**
- **AND** the exposure-mode validation item (if present) SHALL be reported
  independently per the existing `Exposure-mode startup validation failure
  shown cleanly` scenario
- **AND** neither item SHALL be collapsed into a generic
  `Daemon did not become ready` message

#### Scenario: Wizard does not silently mask invalid provider configuration as degraded

- **GIVEN** the operator wrote a provider configuration that is malformed
  (schema violation, missing required credential for a declared provider,
  unparseable values)
- **WHEN** the wizard's health-check step starts the daemon
- **THEN** the daemon startup SHALL fail with the existing validation error
- **AND** the wizard SHALL report a **fail**-level item with the validation
  message
- **AND** the wizard SHALL NOT report a warn-level "No-Op active" item in
  place of the validation failure
