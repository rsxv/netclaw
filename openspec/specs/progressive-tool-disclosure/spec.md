# progressive-tool-disclosure Specification

## Purpose

Define bounded tool schema exposure and actor-local deferred tool activation.

Use the [Netclaw engineering glossary](../../../docs/spec/GLOSSARY.md) for cross-cutting terms used in this specification.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Tool registrations declare an exposure tier

Every registered tool SHALL have a `Core` or `Deferred` exposure tier. A
registration path that does not select `Core` SHALL select `Deferred`. The tier
SHALL NOT replace or widen deployment, audience, grant, or invocation policy.

#### Scenario: New first-party tool defaults to deferred

- **GIVEN** a first-party tool is registered without a core selection
- **WHEN** a session builds its initial model tool set
- **THEN** the new tool is absent from that initial set
- **AND** current policy controls whether the tool is discoverable

#### Scenario: Core selection does not grant a tool

- **GIVEN** current audience policy denies a core tool
- **WHEN** the session builds its initial model tool set
- **THEN** the denied tool is absent
- **AND** search and load do not reveal or activate it

### Requirement: Sessions start with a bounded workspace core

The initial parent-session model tool set SHALL contain policy-exposed definitions for `search_tools`, `load_tool`, `skill_load`, `skill_read_resource`, `set_working_directory`, `file_search`, `file_read`, `file_list`, `file_write`, `file_edit`, `tool_output_read`, `attach_file`, and `shell_execute`. Other first-party and MCP tools SHALL be deferred unless a later specification adds them to the core. The core SHALL NOT include `json_read` or `file_read_many`.

`json_read` and `file_read_many` appear here only as negative regression names.
This change removes their registrations and schemas; it does not defer them.

Sub-agent model tool sets SHALL exclude `attach_file` from core exposure,
discovery, loading, and direct dispatch until an internal attachment
handoff can deliver child attachments through the parent invocation.

Core membership example:

```text
initial core = [search_tools, load_tool, ..., shell_execute]

register ExampleSpecialtyTool with the default Deferred tier
  -> initial core is unchanged
  -> search_tools may find ExampleSpecialtyTool when policy allows it
  -> load_tool may add its schema to one actor

register ExampleCoreTool explicitly as Core
  -> the exact core snapshot changes
  -> that change requires a deliberate specification update
```

#### Scenario: Specialty tools are not eagerly exposed

- **GIVEN** specialty and MCP tools are registered
- **WHEN** a new Personal session begins
- **THEN** their schemas are absent from the initial set
- **AND** policy-exposed tools remain searchable by intent

#### Scenario: Core snapshot stays bounded

- **WHEN** the repository first-party catalog is tested
- **THEN** the core name snapshot equals the specified set
- **AND** another first-party registration does not change that snapshot

#### Scenario: Removed bulk tools are absent

- **WHEN** a parent or child actor builds its core tool set
- **THEN** `json_read` and `file_read_many` are absent
- **AND** `file_read` remains available
- **AND** search, load, and direct dispatch do not resurrect either removed name

### Requirement: Search and load apply the complete exposure policy

`search_tools` and `load_tool` SHALL apply deployment switches, audience allowlists, MCP grants, channel restrictions, and subagent restrictions before they return or activate a tool. Results SHALL NOT reveal a hidden tool name or schema. Loading SHALL add only the definition to the actor exposure set. Normal authorization SHALL still run at dispatch.

Tool guidance SHALL direct an agent to call `load_tool` when it knows the exact tool name. It SHALL direct the agent to call `search_tools` only when it knows an intent but not a name. A known deferred name MAY reach normal dispatch without a prior load, but dispatch SHALL NOT expose its schema or bypass authorization.

When retention and maximum-count tuning are positive, a main session SHALL
retain a loaded deferred schema for `Session.Tuning.DiscoveredToolRetentionTurns`
future user turns. The default is three. Reloading the same tool refreshes that
lease. A non-positive retention or maximum-count value disables cross-turn
retention. The default maximum is twelve loaded schemas; exceeding the cap
evicts the oldest. An LLM failure or session recovery SHALL discard actor-local
loaded schemas. Subagent exposure follows the separate child-run lifetime in
the `netclaw-subagents` specification.

Discovery, exposure, and authority examples:

| Model state and action | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Knows exact allowed name `list_reminders`; calls `load_tool(Name = "list_reminders")` | Expose that schema without a preceding search. |
| Knows only “inspect scheduled tasks”; calls `search_tools(Query = "scheduled tasks")` | Return policy-filtered candidate descriptions, then load one exact result. |
| Searches for a policy-hidden tool | Return no name, schema, or existence hint. |
| Loads an allowed tool that still requires approval, then calls it | Enter normal approval; loading grants nothing. |
| Recalls and directly calls an allowed Deferred name before loading | Dispatch may authorize the call, but the schema does not become loaded merely because dispatch recognized the name. |
| Loads a tool and then the LLM call fails | Evict the loaded schema instead of carrying a possibly harmful exposure set forward. |
| Loads a thirteenth tool with the default maximum of twelve | Retain the newest twelve and evict the oldest loaded schema. |

Default lease example:

```text
user turn 1:
  load_tool(Name = "list_reminders")
  -> schema is available to the next model request in turn 1

user turns 2, 3, and 4:
  -> schema remains available

user turn 5 without another load:
  -> schema is absent

session recovery or LLM failure before turn 5:
  -> schema is absent immediately
```

#### Scenario: Hidden tool cannot be enumerated or loaded

- **GIVEN** a Team session cannot use a registered specialty tool
- **WHEN** it searches for and attempts to load the tool
- **THEN** neither response confirms that the hidden tool exists
- **AND** the model tool set is unchanged

#### Scenario: Exact known name loads without search

- **GIVEN** the prompt index names an allowed deferred tool
- **WHEN** the agent needs that exact tool
- **THEN** guidance directs it to `load_tool` directly
- **AND** no shell probe is required

#### Scenario: Loaded tool still requires invocation authority

- **GIVEN** a deferred tool is loadable and requires approval
- **WHEN** the model loads and calls the tool
- **THEN** the call enters the normal approval pipeline
- **AND** loading does not satisfy approval

#### Scenario: Recalled deferred name still reaches authorization

- **GIVEN** a model calls an allowed registered deferred name before schema load
- **WHEN** dispatch resolves that name
- **THEN** the normal authorization pipeline decides the call
- **AND** no exposure lease grants authority

#### Scenario: Default loaded-tool lease expires after three future turns

- **GIVEN** the main session uses the default retention value of three
- **AND** it loads one policy-visible Deferred tool
- **WHEN** three later user turns complete without another load
- **THEN** the tool schema is available on those three turns
- **AND** it is absent from the fourth later user turn

#### Scenario: Zero retention requires activation each turn

- **GIVEN** `DiscoveredToolRetentionTurns` is zero
- **WHEN** a main session loads a Deferred tool and begins a later user turn
- **THEN** the later turn does not retain that schema
- **AND** the earlier load still grants no execution authority

### Requirement: Deferred exposure is actor-local and recoverable

Loaded deferred tools SHALL be transient actor state. Main-session leases SHALL
use the configured limits. Subagent-loaded tools SHALL exist only for that child
run. Recovery SHALL reseed the core and SHALL NOT require a durable migration.

#### Scenario: Main model failure evicts deferred first-party tool

- **GIVEN** a main session loaded a deferred first-party tool
- **WHEN** an LLM call fails and resets the cache
- **THEN** the next model request omits that tool
- **AND** the core remains available

#### Scenario: Child completion discards loaded tools

- **GIVEN** a subagent loads a deferred tool
- **WHEN** that child stops and another child starts
- **THEN** the new child receives only its policy-exposed core
- **AND** it does not inherit the prior child lease

### Requirement: Agent correction can expose one deferred first-party tool

The closed `UseNativeTool` remediation code and its `NativeToolSuggested` correction fact SHALL be able to request actor-local exposure of one policy-visible deferred first-party tool.

The actor SHALL record the correction result before activating the schema. It
SHALL recheck current exposure policy. It SHALL NOT persist the activation or
treat schema exposure as execution authority.

Required order:

```text
1. Record the model-facing correction result.
2. Read the separate exposure fact with the exact registered tool name.
3. Resolve the exact registration again.
4. Recheck current exposure policy.
5. Add only the schema to the current actor exposure set.
6. Run normal authorization if the model later calls the tool.
```

Exposure examples and counterexamples:

| Correction target | Required exposure result |
|---|---|
| Policy-visible Deferred `list_reminders` | Add only that schema to the next actor request. |
| Policy-visible Core `file_read` | Keep the existing Core schema. Add no duplicate. |
| A tool that policy hides before activation | Add no schema. Reveal no new tool detail. |
| A registration removed before activation | Add no schema. Execute nothing. |
| A later native call after activation | Run normal authorization. The exposure fact grants nothing. |

Main-session recovery and child completion discard the activated deferred
schema. They do not discard a main-session correction message that already
entered durable chat history.

#### Scenario: Deferred target appears on the next model request

- **GIVEN** a complete static shell call contains the exact executable name of a policy-visible deferred first-party tool
- **WHEN** the runtime returns the native-tool correction
- **THEN** the correction result enters model history
- **AND** the next model request contains the target schema
- **AND** calling that schema still enters normal authorization

#### Scenario: Hidden target is not exposed

- **GIVEN** a registered first-party tool is hidden or denied by current policy
- **WHEN** its exact name appears as a shell executable token
- **THEN** no native-tool correction confirms the tool
- **AND** no schema activation occurs

#### Scenario: Activation remains actor-local

- **GIVEN** a correction activates a deferred tool in one actor
- **WHEN** that child completes, the model call fails and evicts leases, or the session recovers
- **THEN** the later exposure set is rebuilt from the policy-filtered core
- **AND** the correction does not create durable exposure state
