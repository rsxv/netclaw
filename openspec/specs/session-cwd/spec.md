## Purpose

Define how a session tracks its project directory and how the agent
declares it via `set_working_directory`. A valid declaration adds the project
directory to the trusted roots that reviewed-safe policy uses.
## Requirements

### Requirement: Relative first-party filesystem paths use session-owned bases

First-party filesystem tools SHALL resolve a relative path against the declared
project directory when one exists. Otherwise, they SHALL use the immutable
session directory. If neither base exists, they SHALL return an
`invalid_context` correction. They SHALL NOT use the daemon process current
directory. The system SHALL request a path access decision for the canonical
path and requested file operation. The decision includes protected-path checks.

#### Scenario: Relative read uses declared project

- **GIVEN** a project directory `/workspace/project` and session `/session/current`
- **WHEN** `file_read` receives `src/App.cs`
- **THEN** it authorizes and reads `/workspace/project/src/App.cs`
- **AND** it does not use the daemon current directory

#### Scenario: Relative write falls back to the session directory

- **GIVEN** no declared project and session directory `/session/current`
- **WHEN** `file_write` receives `notes/result.md`
- **THEN** it resolves `/session/current/notes/result.md`
- **AND** the existing session write policy decides authorization

#### Scenario: Traversal receives no implicit authority

- **GIVEN** project directory `/workspace/project`
- **WHEN** a file tool receives `../../outside.txt`
- **THEN** it canonicalizes the result before policy evaluation
- **AND** it denies the call when the path is outside trusted roots

#### Scenario: Missing base returns correction

- **GIVEN** a tool context has no project or session directory
- **WHEN** a first-party filesystem tool receives a relative path
- **THEN** it returns `invalid_context`
- **AND** it performs no filesystem access

### Requirement: Failed filesystem operations do not change project context

A denied or failed `set_working_directory` or filesystem call SHALL NOT change
the project directory or recent-file context. Only a validated successful
project declaration SHALL replace the project and reload its instructions.

#### Scenario: Denied declaration leaves prior project intact

- **GIVEN** a session declares `/workspace/old`
- **WHEN** `set_working_directory` is denied for `/workspace/new`
- **THEN** the project directory remains `/workspace/old`
- **AND** project instructions are not loaded from the denied path

### Requirement: Session-scoped project directory

Each session SHALL maintain a mutable `ProjectDirectory` in `WorkingContext`
that tracks which project the session is working on. This is the root
directory of the project (where `AGENTS.md` or `.netclaw/AGENTS.md` lives).
The project directory SHALL be independent of the immutable session directory.
The session directory provides the default relative-path base. The project
directory SHALL persist in `SessionSnapshot` through `WorkingContext`. It SHALL
survive compaction, actor recovery, and daemon restart.

#### Scenario: New session has no project directory

- **GIVEN** a session is created with no prior persisted state
- **WHEN** the session actor initializes
- **THEN** `WorkingContext.ProjectDirectory` is null
- **AND** no `[project-instructions]` block is injected

#### Scenario: Project directory survives daemon restart

- **GIVEN** a session has project directory set to `/home/user/workspaces/akadonic`
- **WHEN** the daemon crashes and restarts
- **THEN** the recovered session has project directory equal to
  `/home/user/workspaces/akadonic`
- **AND** the project's identity file is loaded on the first LLM call

#### Scenario: Project directory survives compaction

- **GIVEN** a session has project directory set to `/home/user/workspaces/akadonic`
- **WHEN** context compaction occurs
- **THEN** `WorkingContext.ProjectDirectory` is preserved in the compacted state

#### Scenario: Backward compat for sessions without project directory

- **GIVEN** a session was created before project directory tracking was
  implemented
- **WHEN** the session actor recovers from a snapshot without a project
  directory field
- **THEN** `ProjectDirectory` is null
- **AND** the session functions normally with no `[project-instructions]` block

### Requirement: set_working_directory tool

The system SHALL provide a `set_working_directory` tool that declares the
session's project directory. The tool SHALL validate that the target is a real
directory, resolve its canonical path, and request the shared
`DeclareProjectScope` path access decision. That operation SHALL use read-file
authority while remaining distinct from an ordinary read.

The audience profile `AllowedTools` SHALL control whether the tool is exposed.
Every audience and mode SHALL limit project declarations to the session
directory, current project directory, and configured read roots. User approval
and the default interactive Personal `All` file profile SHALL NOT widen those
declaration roots.

A successful declaration SHALL update project scope, add the directory to the
trusted roots used by reviewed-safe shell policy, and load project identity
files into the system prompt. The model-visible description SHALL present the
tool as project declaration, not as a shell `cd` command.

#### Scenario: set_working_directory updates project directory

- **GIVEN** a session with no project directory set
- **AND** the audience trust profile allows declarations under `/home/user`
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `set_working_directory` with
  path `/home/user/workspaces/akadonic`
- **THEN** the session project directory is set to
  `/home/user/workspaces/akadonic`
- **AND** the project's identity file is loaded on the next LLM call
- **AND** subsequent shell calls inside that directory may receive reviewed-safe
  coverage

#### Scenario: set_working_directory rejected outside trusted roots

- **GIVEN** a session whose project declarations are limited to `/home/user`
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `set_working_directory` with path `/etc/nginx`
- **THEN** the project directory remains unchanged
- **AND** the tool reports that the path is outside trusted roots

#### Scenario: set_working_directory rejected for nonexistent directory

- **GIVEN** a session with read authority under `/home/user`
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `set_working_directory` with
  path `/home/user/nonexistent`
- **THEN** the project directory remains unchanged
- **AND** the tool reports that the directory does not exist

#### Scenario: Personal audience limits project declaration to trusted roots

- **GIVEN** a default Personal file profile with broad interactive read access
- **AND** a valid target outside the session, current project, and configured
  read roots
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `set_working_directory` with that target
- **THEN** the project directory is not updated
- **AND** the declaration is denied even though an ordinary interactive
  Personal read of the same path may be allowed

#### Scenario: set_working_directory not exposed to public audience

- **GIVEN** a Public session
- **WHEN** the tool exposure list is computed
- **THEN** `set_working_directory` is not included

#### Scenario: Switching projects replaces context

- **GIVEN** a session with project directory `/home/user/workspaces/akadonic`
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `set_working_directory` with
  path `/home/user/workspaces/other-project`
- **THEN** the project directory changes to `/home/user/workspaces/other-project`
- **AND** the next LLM call loads identity files from the new project
- **AND** the old project's identity files are no longer injected
- **AND** the reviewed-safe trusted root switches to the new project directory

### Requirement: Shell tool cwd selection is explicit and deterministic

`ShellTool` SHALL resolve the working directory for every invocation
in this priority order: explicit `WorkingDirectory` argument when
provided, else `WorkingContext.ProjectDirectory` when set, else
`session_dir` (`<session-envelope>/workspace` for a version-2 session).
`ShellTool` SHALL NOT fall
through to `ProcessStartInfo`'s default behavior of inheriting the
daemon process's cwd.

This rule gives each shell invocation a known cwd below a declared trusted
root, unless the call supplies an explicit override. The approval policy uses
the applicable path access decision for that cwd.

#### Scenario: Cwd defaults to project_dir when set

- **GIVEN** a session with `WorkingContext.ProjectDirectory` set to
  `~/repos/foo/`
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `shell_execute` with command `pwd` and
  no `WorkingDirectory`
- **THEN** the command runs with cwd `~/repos/foo/`

#### Scenario: Cwd defaults to session_dir when project_dir is null

- **GIVEN** a session with `WorkingContext.ProjectDirectory` null
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `shell_execute` with command `pwd` and
  no `WorkingDirectory`
- **THEN** the command runs with cwd `<session-envelope>/workspace`

#### Scenario: Explicit WorkingDirectory overrides default

- **GIVEN** a session with `WorkingContext.ProjectDirectory` set to
  `~/repos/foo/`
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `shell_execute` with command `pwd` and
  `WorkingDirectory` `/tmp/`
- **THEN** the command runs with cwd `/tmp/`
- **AND** the approval gate requests a path access decision for `/tmp/`

#### Scenario: Cwd never inherits daemon process cwd

- **GIVEN** the daemon process was launched with cwd `/var/lib/netclawd/`
- **AND** a session has neither `project_dir` set nor an explicit
  `WorkingDirectory` argument
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `shell_execute`
- **THEN** the command does NOT run with cwd `/var/lib/netclawd/`
- **AND** the resolved cwd is `session_dir`

### Requirement: Shell tool failure-path hint for cwd outside trusted roots

`ShellTool` SHALL include a one-line remediation hint in the model result when
a call is denied because its cwd is outside trusted roots. The remediation
presenter SHALL add the hint only when an applicable remediation is available.

For a non-temp cwd, the hint SHALL suggest `set_working_directory <path>` only
when that tool is exposed. The same path access decision used by that tool
SHALL accept the exact path without substitution. For a Personal cwd at the
captured platform temporary root, the hint SHALL identify the managed
temporary directory. It SHALL NOT suggest a project declaration for the
platform temporary root. Team and Public calls retain their earlier denial
boundary. Public results retain existing path redaction.

The hint SHALL NOT appear for hard-deny-list refusals or protected-path
denials. It SHALL NOT appear when the managed temporary directory is
unavailable. It SHALL NOT appear when `set_working_directory` would reject a
non-temp cwd.

#### Scenario: Denial in declarable foreign tree includes set_working_directory hint

- **GIVEN** a Personal session with `project_dir` not set
- **AND** the shared directory policy accepts `~/repos/bar/`
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `shell_execute` with cwd `~/repos/bar/`
- **AND** the user denies the resulting prompt
- **THEN** the tool result includes a hint pointing at `set_working_directory ~/repos/bar/`

#### Scenario: Denied platform-temp retry retains managed-temp recommendation

- **GIVEN** an agent received the managed-temp remediation for the platform
  temporary root
- **AND** it repeated the original call unchanged to request ordinary approval
- **WHEN** the user denies that approval
- **THEN** the remediation presenter identifies the exact managed temporary
  directory
- **AND** it does not suggest `set_working_directory` for the platform temporary root

#### Scenario: Undeclarable foreign tree has no project declaration hint

- **GIVEN** a non-temp cwd is outside the roots accepted by `set_working_directory`
- **WHEN** the user denies the resulting shell prompt
- **THEN** the tool result does not suggest declaring that cwd

#### Scenario: Hint is not emitted for hard-deny refusals

- **GIVEN** a hard-deny-list block on the command
- **WHEN** `shell_execute` returns the deny error
- **THEN** the result does NOT include a working-directory remediation hint

#### Scenario: Hint is not emitted when remediation tools are unavailable

- **GIVEN** a Public session where `set_working_directory` is not exposed
- **AND** no private managed-temp remediation is available
- **WHEN** a shell call is denied because its cwd is outside trusted roots
- **THEN** the result does NOT include a working-directory remediation hint

### Requirement: Working context block includes project directory

The system SHALL include the current project directory in the
`[working-context]` block emitted by `WorkingContext.ToContextBlock()`
when the project directory is set.

#### Scenario: Project directory included in working context block

- **GIVEN** a session has project directory set to
  `/home/user/workspaces/akadonic` and recent files
- **WHEN** `ToContextBlock()` is called
- **THEN** the output includes `project_dir: /home/user/workspaces/akadonic`
  alongside the recent files listing

### Requirement: Working context includes derived Git worktree state
For Team and Personal turns whose `WorkingContext.ProjectDirectory` is declared and Git identifies it as a worktree, the system SHALL asynchronously derive a fresh Git snapshot at turn start and render it as a nested section of `[working-context]`. The snapshot SHALL include worktree root, common repository directory, branch or detached state, HEAD, upstream and ahead/behind when configured, and staged, modified, and untracked counts. Derived Git state SHALL NOT be persisted in session state. Git inspection SHALL return explicit available, not-repository, executable-not-found, or unavailable outcomes.

#### Scenario: Linked worktree is distinguished from common repository
- **GIVEN** a Team or Personal session project directory inside a linked Git worktree
- **WHEN** the next turn-start working-context snapshot is built
- **THEN** the model-visible context identifies the linked worktree path and common repository directory
- **AND** reports the linked worktree's branch and HEAD

#### Scenario: Git state refreshes on the next turn
- **GIVEN** a tool changes branch, HEAD, or dirty state during one turn
- **WHEN** the session begins its next turn
- **THEN** the new volatile working-context nudge contains the updated Git snapshot
- **AND** earlier history messages are not rewritten

#### Scenario: Non-Git project has no Git section
- **GIVEN** a declared project directory that Git identifies as not a repository
- **WHEN** working context is assembled
- **THEN** normal project and recent-file context remains available
- **AND** no Git section is rendered

#### Scenario: Git inspection failure is visible
- **GIVEN** an eligible project directory whose Git state cannot be inspected because Git is missing, times out, or the repository is invalid
- **WHEN** working context is assembled
- **THEN** Git status is reported as unavailable with a sanitized reason
- **AND** the failure is not represented as a clean or non-Git worktree

#### Scenario: Stale Git result is discarded
- **GIVEN** asynchronous Git inspection began for an earlier turn generation
- **WHEN** its result arrives after the session has advanced to another turn
- **THEN** the actor discards the stale result
- **AND** it is not rendered into the active turn

#### Scenario: Git remote credentials are never rendered
- **GIVEN** a repository with a credential-bearing remote URL
- **WHEN** Git working context is rendered
- **THEN** no remote credentials or complete remote URL appears in model-visible context or logs

#### Scenario: Contradictory Git head metadata is unavailable

- **GIVEN** Git reports a detached head with upstream metadata, a detached unborn head, or divergence without an upstream
- **WHEN** the inspector parses that status
- **THEN** the inspector returns the existing unavailable outcome with a bounded reason
- **AND** the model receives no contradictory branch or tracking state


#### Scenario: Invalid public Git snapshot does not interrupt a turn

- **GIVEN** a caller constructs or deserializes a Git snapshot with contradictory head fields
- **WHEN** the context renderer processes the snapshot
- **THEN** it emits the existing unavailable status with a reason
- **AND** it emits no branch or commit details and does not modify the snapshot
- **AND** the session can continue its turn

### Requirement: Project-directory declarations reject control characters

The `set_working_directory` tool SHALL reject a path that contains NUL, CR, or
LF before filesystem resolution. The tool SHALL return a bounded error without
echoing the authored path.

#### Scenario: Controlled path cannot become project scope

- **GIVEN** a path contains NUL, CR, or LF
- **WHEN** an agent calls `set_working_directory` with that path
- **THEN** the tool returns an error without the authored path
- **AND** the project scope remains unchanged
- **AND** project instructions are not loaded from that path

#### Scenario: Invalid public Git snapshot does not interrupt a turn

- **GIVEN** a caller constructs or deserializes a Git snapshot with contradictory head fields
- **WHEN** the context renderer processes the snapshot
- **THEN** it emits the existing unavailable status with a reason
- **AND** it emits no branch or commit details and does not modify the snapshot
- **AND** the session can continue its turn

### Requirement: Existing session context announces managed paths

The system SHALL preserve the existing `[session]` context block and its
`session_dir` entry. It SHALL extend that same block with the applicable
`temp_dir`, `artifact_dir`, `worktree_dir`, and `log_path` entries for Personal
and Team parent and child runs. It SHALL NOT add a second context block or
repeat these paths in per-turn guidance.

The system SHALL state the distinct purpose of each path. Public context SHALL
retain its existing private-path policy. The guidance SHALL preserve an
explicitly required platform temporary path.

The context SHALL derive from the existing parent or child run scope. It SHALL
NOT add a public protocol field, persist a path as agent identity, or change
shell authorization.

For a parent with a version-2 storage binding, `session_dir` SHALL mean
`<session-envelope>/workspace`. For a child, `temp_dir` and `artifact_dir`
SHALL be siblings below `<session-envelope>/subagents/<run-id>`. The context
SHALL NOT use `session_dir` as a synonym for the complete storage envelope.
It SHALL describe `session_dir` as the working directory and relative-path
fallback. It SHALL describe `temp_dir` as disposable run-local storage. Current
runtime prompts and tool schemas SHALL NOT call either path “session scratch.”

#### Scenario: Example - Personal child receives distinct managed paths

- **GIVEN** a Personal child has a bound session and run scope
- **WHEN** Netclaw assembles its initial model context
- **THEN** the context contains its exact session, temporary, and artifact
  directories
- **AND** it contains the session's exact worktree directory
- **AND** it contains the exact log path for that child run
- **AND** it describes `temp_dir` as disposable working storage
- **AND** it describes `artifact_dir` as the location for outputs that the
  parent or user must keep
- **AND** it does not imply that path knowledge grants shell authority

#### Scenario: Example - Personal parent extends the existing session block

- **GIVEN** a Personal parent already receives `[session]` with `session_dir`
- **WHEN** Netclaw assembles its first model context for the new layout
- **THEN** the same block also contains `temp_dir`, `artifact_dir`,
  `worktree_dir`, and `log_path`
- **AND** no second session block contains duplicate path guidance

#### Scenario: Team child receives distinct managed paths

- **GIVEN** a Team child has a valid bound run scope
- **WHEN** Netclaw assembles its initial model context
- **THEN** the context contains that run's exact managed paths
- **AND** it identifies the current run's `log_path`
- **AND** existing Team tool and shell policy remains unchanged

#### Scenario: Counterexample - Public child cannot receive private paths

- **GIVEN** a Public child has internal managed paths
- **WHEN** Netclaw assembles its initial model context
- **THEN** the context does not contain those paths
- **AND** no replacement guidance discloses another private filesystem path

#### Scenario: Counterexample - implementation cannot replace context assembly

- **GIVEN** the current parent and child context assemblers already emit
  `session_dir`
- **WHEN** the implementation adds the new path entries
- **THEN** it extends those existing assembly seams
- **AND** it does not create another prompt provider or context protocol

#### Scenario: Counterexample - explicit platform temporary intent is preserved

- **GIVEN** a Personal or Team child receives managed-path guidance
- **WHEN** its task explicitly requires the platform temporary directory
- **THEN** the guidance tells the child to preserve that requirement
- **AND** Netclaw does not rewrite the path or grant authority to it

#### Scenario: Project declaration does not replace managed paths

- **GIVEN** a child has received its initial managed-path context
- **WHEN** it later calls `set_working_directory` successfully
- **THEN** its project scope and project instructions update through the
  existing contract
- **AND** its bound session, temporary, and artifact paths remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Example - file schemas name the relative-path fallback correctly

- **GIVEN** a workspace file tool accepts a relative path
- **WHEN** its model-visible schema describes path resolution
- **THEN** it says that the current project is tried before the session
  directory
- **AND** it does not describe the session directory as disposable scratch

#### Scenario: Counterexample - disposable guidance cannot point to session_dir

- **GIVEN** the model needs a location for disposable run-local output
- **WHEN** Netclaw renders managed-path guidance
- **THEN** the guidance points to `temp_dir`
- **AND** it does not tell the model to use `session_dir` as scratch

### Requirement: Managed temporary directory is the private temporary location

The system SHALL provide a separate managed temporary directory for each
parent and child run. A version-2 parent SHALL use
`<session-envelope>/tmp/parent`. A child SHALL use
`<session-envelope>/subagents/<run-id>/tmp`. The system SHALL identify this
directory as the preferred location for disposable files. It SHALL use the
session directory, not the complete envelope, as the shell working-directory
fallback when no project or explicit working directory exists.

Personal and Team working context and correction text SHALL provide the
absolute managed temporary path when the agent needs an alternative to the
platform temporary root. Public context SHALL retain existing private-path
redaction. The system SHALL NOT silently substitute a path or imply that
temporary-directory cleanup occurs as part of this behavior.

#### Scenario: Example - no-project shell separates cwd and temp

- **GIVEN** a session has no declared project directory
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `shell_execute` without an explicit working
  directory
- **THEN** the shell working directory is the bound session directory at
  `<session-envelope>/workspace`
- **AND** temporary APIs in the process resolve to the managed temporary
  directory

#### Scenario: Counterexample - complete envelope is not the fallback cwd

- **GIVEN** a version-2 session has raw logs and child runs in its envelope
- **WHEN** the agent invokes `shell_execute` without a project or explicit cwd
- **THEN** the shell does not start at `<session-envelope>`
- **AND** a recursive search of `.` does not include those sibling areas

#### Scenario: Parent and child temporary directories do not collide

- **GIVEN** a parent and two child runs belong to one session
- **WHEN** Netclaw resolves their managed temporary directories
- **THEN** each run receives a different directory
- **AND** every directory remains below the same session envelope

#### Scenario: Example - correction names the managed temporary directory

- **GIVEN** a correction recommends private temporary storage
- **WHEN** the correction is rendered for the agent
- **THEN** it names the exact managed temporary directory for that run
- **AND** it does not name the complete session envelope as disposable storage

#### Scenario: Counterexample - Public context cannot receive managed paths

- **GIVEN** a Public parent or child agent
- **WHEN** it evaluates a platform-temp operation
- **THEN** it does not receive a private managed path
- **AND** existing Public path-redaction behavior remains

#### Scenario: Counterexample - session end does not imply cleanup

- **GIVEN** an agent writes a disposable file under its managed temporary
  directory
- **WHEN** the current session ends
- **THEN** this capability does not delete or schedule deletion of that file
- **AND** retention remains unchanged until a separate cleanup capability is
  specified

### Requirement: Every run receives the standard temporary environment

Before the system starts a shell or another child process, it SHALL create and
validate the run's managed temporary directory. It SHALL set `TMPDIR`, `TMP`,
and `TEMP` to that exact directory in the child process environment. It SHALL
set all three variables on POSIX and Windows. It SHALL NOT change the daemon's
global process environment.

The system SHALL capture the host platform temporary root before it injects
the managed values. Policy that identifies an explicitly authored unmanaged
temporary path SHALL use that captured host value. It SHALL NOT assume a fixed
Windows temporary path.

#### Scenario: Example - POSIX child process uses managed temp

- **GIVEN** a POSIX parent or child run has a managed temporary directory
- **WHEN** Netclaw starts a shell process
- **THEN** `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, and `TEMP` all equal that directory
- **AND** a standard temporary-path API returns a path below it

#### Scenario: Example - Windows child process uses managed temp

- **GIVEN** a Windows parent or child run has a managed temporary directory
- **WHEN** Netclaw starts a shell process
- **THEN** `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, and `TEMP` all equal that directory
- **AND** the native or .NET temporary-path API returns a path below it

#### Scenario: Sibling runs keep isolated environments

- **GIVEN** two child runs execute concurrently
- **WHEN** each reads its temporary environment
- **THEN** each sees only its own managed temporary path
- **AND** the daemon environment remains unchanged

#### Scenario: Counterexample - failed preparation cannot use host temp

- **GIVEN** the managed temporary directory cannot be created or validated
- **WHEN** Netclaw prepares a shell or child process
- **THEN** process creation fails before user code runs
- **AND** Netclaw does not fall back to the host platform temporary root

#### Scenario: Example - old background job record remains readable

- **GIVEN** a persisted background job definition predates the
  `ManagedTemporaryDirectory` property
- **WHEN** the current daemon loads that JSON after restart
- **THEN** it preserves the job's terminal history
- **AND** a pending or running job follows the existing restart contract and
  becomes `Lost`
- **AND** the owning session receives the existing lost-job notification
- **AND** the daemon does not resume the job with the host temporary root

### Requirement: Bash launcher sets HOME and PWD and removes CDPATH

When the system starts a Bash shell process, it SHALL set these variables in
the child process environment only:

- `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, and `TEMP`: the run's managed temporary directory, as the
  requirement "Every run receives the standard temporary environment" states.
- `HOME`: the daemon user profile directory. The daemon SHALL read this value
  one time, when it creates the shell environment at startup. The value SHALL
  stay the same for the life of the daemon process.
- `PWD`: the exact working directory of the shell process.

The system SHALL remove `CDPATH` from the Bash child environment. If the user
profile directory is not an absolute path, the system SHALL NOT set `HOME`. The
child process then keeps the `HOME` value of the daemon process. A PowerShell
process SHALL NOT receive the `HOME` or `PWD` value from this requirement.

The launcher and the shell approval parser SHALL read the temporary and `HOME`
values from one shared variable list. The parser SHALL use the same working
directory value that the launcher writes to `PWD`. The two values SHALL NOT be
computed separately.

#### Scenario: Example - Bash process receives the launch variables

- **GIVEN** a POSIX run with a managed temporary directory and a working
  directory
- **AND** the daemon user profile is an absolute path
- **WHEN** Netclaw starts a Bash shell process for the run
- **THEN** `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, and `TEMP` equal the managed temporary directory
- **AND** `HOME` equals the user profile that the daemon read at startup
- **AND** `PWD` equals the working directory
- **AND** `CDPATH` is not set

#### Scenario: Example - relative cd follows the working directory through a link

- **GIVEN** the working directory path contains a symbolic link
- **WHEN** the shell process runs `cd sub` and then `cd ../..`
- **THEN** each `cd` goes to the directory that the approval parser resolved
  lexically from the working directory

#### Scenario: Counterexample - home that is not absolute gives no HOME value

- **GIVEN** the daemon user profile is not an absolute path
- **WHEN** Netclaw starts a Bash shell process
- **THEN** Netclaw does not set `HOME` on the child process
- **AND** the approval parser has no `HOME` launch value

### Requirement: Approval parser trusts a launch variable only while it is unchanged

The shell approval parser SHALL use a launch value only when the selected shell
host has a proven no-startup initial state. For Bash, this state requires a
probed GNU Bash 5.2 or 5.3 at `/bin/bash`, started with only `-c`. The parser
SHALL resolve `$TMPDIR`, `$TMP`, `$TEMP`, and `$HOME` to the launch values in
that state. It SHALL resolve a relative `cd` from the working directory, because
the launcher removes `CDPATH`.

A command that resolves to a launch value SHALL receive the same approval
decision as the same command with the literal path. A stored grant for the
literal directory SHALL apply.

The parser SHALL treat a launch value as unknown after any statement that can
change it. Examples are an assignment, `export`, a prefix assignment, `unset`,
`read`, and `source`. The parser SHALL also treat `CDPATH` as unknown after the
source sets it. The parser SHALL NOT use launch values for source that another
process reads, for example the child of a `bash -lc` wrapper. An unknown value
SHALL stay unresolved. The parser SHALL NOT replace it with the launch value or
with another default.

#### Scenario: Example - $HOME gets the decision of the literal path

- **GIVEN** a Bash host with a proven no-startup initial state
- **AND** the launch `HOME` value is `/home/alice`
- **WHEN** the agent submits `cat "$HOME/x"`
- **THEN** the approval decision equals the decision for `cat /home/alice/x`
- **AND** a stored `cat` grant that covers `/home/alice` allows the command

#### Scenario: Example - $TMPDIR gets the decision of the literal path

- **GIVEN** a Bash host with a proven no-startup initial state
- **WHEN** the agent submits `cat "$TMPDIR/notes.txt"`
- **THEN** the approval decision equals the decision for the literal path below
  the managed temporary directory

#### Scenario: Counterexample - changed HOME is not trusted

- **GIVEN** a Bash host with a proven no-startup initial state
- **WHEN** the agent submits `export HOME=/etc; cat "$HOME/x"`
- **THEN** the parser does not resolve `$HOME` to the launch value
- **AND** the command does not receive an allow decision from the launch value

#### Scenario: Counterexample - changed CDPATH keeps a relative cd unresolved

- **GIVEN** a Bash host with a proven no-startup initial state
- **AND** stored grants allow `cd` and `cat` in the project directory
- **WHEN** the agent submits `CDPATH=/etc; cd sub && cat notes.txt`
- **THEN** the relative `cd` stays unresolved
- **AND** the command is not allowed

#### Scenario: Counterexample - wrapped shell does not use launch values

- **GIVEN** a Bash host with a proven no-startup initial state
- **WHEN** the agent submits `bash -lc 'cat "$TMPDIR/notes.txt"'`
- **THEN** the parser does not resolve the inner `$TMPDIR` to the launch value
- **AND** the command is not allowed

#### Scenario: Counterexample - unproved Bash host does not use launch values

- **GIVEN** a Bash host without a proven no-startup initial state
- **WHEN** the agent submits `cat "$TMPDIR/notes.txt"`
- **THEN** the parser does not resolve `$TMPDIR` to the launch value
- **AND** the command is not allowed

### Requirement: Worktrees have a separate session-owned area

The system SHALL distinguish managed worktrees from ordinary temporary files.
It SHALL expose `<session-envelope>/worktrees` as `worktree_dir` in the existing
session context and SHALL NOT place that directory below a run's managed
temporary directory. Agents SHALL use existing shell and project-scope tools
to create and adopt worktrees. This capability SHALL NOT define automatic
worktree cleanup or a worktree-specific tool.

#### Scenario: Example - worktree stays outside run temp

- **GIVEN** an agent needs a Git worktree
- **WHEN** it chooses a destination below the announced `worktree_dir`
- **THEN** it is below the session worktree area
- **AND** it is not below the parent or child temporary directory

#### Scenario: Counterexample - session end does not delete worktree

- **GIVEN** a managed worktree contains source changes
- **WHEN** the session ends
- **THEN** this capability does not delete the worktree
- **AND** later cleanup requires a separate policy

#### Scenario: Counterexample - worktree directory is not a temporary API root

- **GIVEN** a child process calls a standard temporary-path API
- **WHEN** Netclaw has injected the run environment
- **THEN** the API resolves below `temp_dir`
- **AND** it does not resolve below `worktree_dir`

### Requirement: Project work takes precedence over managed temporary work

Parent and subagent guidance SHALL use declared project scope for work that
belongs to that project. The managed temporary directory SHALL hold disposable
work outside a project. A successful project declaration SHALL not cause later
project commands to select `temp_dir` as an explicit
`WorkingDirectory`. This guidance SHALL NOT change runtime cwd resolution or
grant shell authority.

#### Scenario: Declared project remains the default for project work

- **GIVEN** `project_dir` names the project for the current task
- **WHEN** the agent runs a project shell command without a one-call override
- **THEN** guidance tells it to omit `WorkingDirectory`
- **AND** runtime cwd resolution selects `project_dir`
- **AND** guidance does not select `session_dir` for that command

#### Scenario: A named project is declared before project tool use

- **GIVEN** a task names a project that differs from `project_dir`
- **AND** `set_working_directory` is available
- **WHEN** the task needs a shell or file tool in that project
- **THEN** guidance tells the agent to declare the project once
- **AND** the declaration precedes the first shell or file tool call
- **AND** the declaration does not grant shell authority

#### Scenario: A rejected named path is corrected before project work

- **GIVEN** a task names a project path and a fallback project path
- **AND** `set_working_directory` is available
- **WHEN** the first declaration is rejected
- **THEN** guidance declares the fallback before another project tool
- **AND** the first declaration uses the task's first project path exactly
- **AND** guidance does not substitute an enclosing directory before rejection
- **AND** guidance does not probe either path before its declaration
- **AND** neither declaration grants shell authority

#### Scenario: Child declaration governs later child project commands

- **GIVEN** a subagent successfully declares a different user-named project
- **WHEN** it runs later shell commands for that project
- **THEN** guidance uses the child `project_dir`
- **AND** it does not pass the parent `temp_dir` as `WorkingDirectory`
- **AND** it does not add an inline directory change to reach the project

#### Scenario: One call in a child directory uses typed scope

- **GIVEN** `project_dir` names a project root
- **AND** one shell call must run in a named child directory or worktree
- **WHEN** the agent authors that call
- **THEN** `Command` contains only the shell operation
- **AND** `WorkingDirectory` contains the exact child directory
- **AND** the persistent project root does not change

#### Scenario: Disposable work outside a project uses managed temporary storage

- **GIVEN** a task creates disposable artifacts that do not belong to a project
- **AND** the audience can see its managed temporary directory
- **AND** the task does not require a platform temporary path
- **WHEN** the agent selects a working directory
- **THEN** guidance selects `temp_dir`
- **AND** writable artifacts do not use platform temporary storage
- **AND** it does not declare the managed temporary directory as a project

#### Scenario: Requested directory transition remains authored behavior

- **GIVEN** the task explicitly asks to test or perform a shell directory transition
- **WHEN** the agent authors the shell call
- **THEN** guidance preserves the inline transition
- **AND** the call follows ordinary approval policy

#### Scenario: Project declaration does not authorize project commands

- **GIVEN** an agent successfully declares a project
- **WHEN** it authors a prompt-worthy command in that project
- **THEN** the declaration supplies only a trusted root
- **AND** the command still needs reviewed-safe, one-time, session, or stored authority

### Requirement: Parent and child contexts share one directory-selection order

Personal and Team parent and subagent contexts SHALL state the same directory
selection order. Project work SHALL use `project_dir`. A named one-call child
scope SHALL use typed `WorkingDirectory`. Disposable non-project work SHALL use
`temp_dir`. An inline directory change SHALL remain only for requested
directory behavior. Public context SHALL not reveal a private project or
session path.

#### Scenario: Parent context contains the complete order

- **GIVEN** a Personal or Team parent context has project and session paths
- **WHEN** the context is assembled
- **THEN** it distinguishes project work from managed temporary work
- **AND** it distinguishes one-call typed scope from persistent project scope

#### Scenario: Child context contains the complete order

- **GIVEN** a Personal or Team child receives project and session context
- **WHEN** its first model message is assembled
- **THEN** it receives the same directory-selection order as the parent
- **AND** the session rule does not use an unconditional temporary-directory instruction

#### Scenario: Project refresh does not duplicate temporary guidance

- **GIVEN** a child context already contains one managed-temporary-directory rule
- **WHEN** `set_working_directory` refreshes child project context
- **THEN** the next prompt contains the updated `project_dir`
- **AND** it contains exactly one managed-temporary-directory rule
- **AND** the directory-selection order remains unchanged

#### Scenario: Public context stays redacted

- **GIVEN** a Public parent or subagent context
- **WHEN** the context is assembled
- **THEN** no private `project_dir` or `session_dir` value is disclosed
- **AND** no unavailable scope tool is recommended

#### Scenario: Failed declaration preserves prior scope

- **GIVEN** `set_working_directory` rejects a requested path
- **WHEN** the next model call starts
- **THEN** the prior project scope remains unchanged
- **AND** guidance does not treat the rejected path as declared
- **AND** an authored shell call follows ordinary approval policy
