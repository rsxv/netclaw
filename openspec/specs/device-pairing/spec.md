# device-pairing Specification

## Purpose

Define the bearer token authentication scheme, pairing code exchange flow,
paired device registry, device management commands, and CLI token attachment
for self-hosted remote access without an external identity provider.

This capability uses these [engineering glossary](../../../docs/spec/GLOSSARY.md) terms:

- [Local-control proof](../../../docs/spec/GLOSSARY.md#local-control-proof)
- [Pairing code](../../../docs/spec/GLOSSARY.md#pairing-code)
- [Device token](../../../docs/spec/GLOSSARY.md#device-token)
- [Authority](../../../docs/spec/GLOSSARY.md#authority)
- [Durable and ephemeral](../../../docs/spec/GLOSSARY.md#durable-and-ephemeral)

## Pairing State Flow

```text
host proof -> create process-local code
remote code + device name -> validate code -> write durable device -> consume code
                                               |
                                               +-> failure keeps the code
```

The diagram is schematic.
It omits rate limits, token hashing, and HTTP status mapping.

| Decision or data | Owner | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| Pending code | Daemon pairing subsystem | Process-local |
| Exchange order | Daemon pairing subsystem | Process-local |
| Raw device token | Daemon pairing subsystem | Call-local |
| Device record and token hash | Device registry | Durable |

## Credential Lifecycle

| Credential | Authority | Lifetime | Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local-control proof | One named host operation | 30 seconds and one use | Run `netclaw daemon pair` again |
| Pairing code | One successful device registration | Five minutes and one use | Create a new code on the daemon host |
| Device token | Paired-device access | Until operator revocation | Use the normal pairing flow again |

The pairing code and the device token are bearer credentials.
The device token has no automatic expiration or refresh flow.
Pairing-code expiration does not invalidate an existing device token.

## Requirements
### Requirement: Bearer token authentication scheme

The daemon SHALL register a bearer token authentication scheme that validates device tokens on SignalR and HTTP control-plane connections. The scheme SHALL read the token from the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on the request. Valid tokens SHALL produce Netclaw claims with `Operator` principal, `Verified` transport, and the paired device ID as sender.

In exposure modes that require remote authentication, this scheme SHALL remain eligible even when the control-plane endpoint is loopback. Loopback origin alone SHALL NOT suppress bearer-token authentication in those modes.

#### Scenario: Valid bearer token accepted

- **GIVEN** a remote connection provides a bearer token matching a paired device
- **WHEN** the bearer token scheme evaluates the connection
- **THEN** authentication succeeds with `PrincipalClassification = Operator`, `TransportAuthenticity = Verified`, and `SenderId` = the device name

#### Scenario: Invalid bearer token rejected

- **GIVEN** a remote connection provides a bearer token that does not match any paired device
- **WHEN** the bearer token scheme evaluates the connection
- **THEN** authentication fails

#### Scenario: Missing bearer token defers to other schemes

- **GIVEN** a connection provides no bearer token
- **WHEN** the bearer token scheme evaluates the connection
- **THEN** the scheme returns `NoResult` (defers to loopback or other schemes)

#### Scenario: Loopback control-plane endpoint still accepts bearer token in reverse-proxy mode

- **GIVEN** `Daemon.ExposureMode` is `reverse-proxy`
- **AND** a daemon-host CLI connects to a loopback control-plane endpoint
- **AND** the CLI provides a valid paired-device bearer token
- **WHEN** the bearer token scheme evaluates the request
- **THEN** authentication succeeds through the bearer-token path
- **AND** the request does not depend on loopback auto-auth

#### Scenario: Direct local control-plane endpoint accepts bearer token on the daemon host

- **GIVEN** `Daemon.ExposureMode` is `reverse-proxy`
- **AND** the daemon host CLI connects directly to the daemon's configured non-loopback bind address
- **AND** the CLI provides a valid paired-device bearer token
- **WHEN** the bearer token scheme evaluates the request
- **THEN** authentication succeeds through the bearer-token path
- **AND** the request does not depend on loopback auto-auth

### Requirement: Pairing code exchange

A remote CLI SHALL exchange a valid pairing code for a long-lived device token via `netclaw pair <endpoint>`.
The exchange SHALL use an unauthenticated endpoint that is separate from the main hub.
The daemon SHALL validate the code before it checks the device name.
The daemon SHALL consume the code only after it stores the new device.
The daemon SHALL prevent another exchange or code request from changing the accepted code during its durable write.
The daemon SHALL NOT repeat the expiration check after that durable write.
The device registry SHALL replace its durable file only after a complete write to a sibling temporary file.
The registry SHALL preserve its prior file and cache if a write fails before replacement.
The remote CLI SHALL not persist a token or endpoint after a failed exchange.
The remote CLI SHALL require HTTPS for a non-loopback endpoint.
The remote CLI MAY use HTTP for a loopback endpoint.
The remote CLI SHALL NOT follow an HTTP redirect during code exchange.
The remote CLI SHALL limit each success or error response body to 4 KiB before JSON parsing.
The CLI MAY read one additional byte to detect an oversized body.
The CLI SHALL enforce a 15-second deadline through the response body read.

#### Scenario: Successful pairing exchange

- **GIVEN** the valid code is `ABCD-EFGH`
- **WHEN** a remote CLI submits the code with device name `tablet`
- **THEN** the daemon stores the device and token hash
- **AND** the daemon returns the raw device token once
- **AND** the daemon consumes the pairing code

#### Scenario: Remote CLI stores token

- **GIVEN** a successful pairing exchange returned a device token
- **WHEN** the remote CLI receives the token
- **THEN** it stores the token in `secrets.json` under `DeviceToken`
- **AND** it stores the daemon endpoint for later connections

#### Scenario: Duplicate device name preserves the code

- **GIVEN** a valid and unexpired pairing code exists
- **AND** the requested device name `laptop` already exists
- **WHEN** the remote CLI submits the code and name
- **THEN** the daemon returns a conflict response
- **AND** the pairing code remains valid until its normal expiration

#### Scenario: Failed write preserves existing devices

- **GIVEN** device `laptop` has a valid token and an unexpired code exists for `tablet`
- **WHEN** a registry write fails before replacement
- **THEN** the prior registry bytes and cached device records remain unchanged
- **AND** a fresh registry instance still accepts the `laptop` token
- **AND** a retry can register `tablet` with the same unexpired code after the failure clears

#### Scenario: Duplicate retry uses the same code

- **GIVEN** code `ABCD-EFGH` received a conflict for device name `laptop`
- **WHEN** the remote CLI retries `ABCD-EFGH` with device name `tablet`
- **THEN** the daemon stores `tablet`
- **AND** the daemon consumes `ABCD-EFGH`

#### Scenario: Duplicate conflict gives a safe retry

- **GIVEN** the daemon rejects device name `laptop` as a duplicate
- **WHEN** the remote CLI reports the conflict
- **THEN** it tells the operator to select a different device name
- **AND** it tells the operator to reuse the same unexpired code

#### Scenario: Expired code requires a new code

- **GIVEN** code `ABCD-EFGH` has expired
- **WHEN** the remote CLI submits it
- **THEN** the daemon rejects the exchange without a registry change
- **AND** the CLI tells the operator to run `netclaw daemon pair` again

#### Scenario: Registry failure preserves the code

- **GIVEN** a valid and unexpired pairing code exists
- **WHEN** the device registry write fails
- **THEN** the request fails visibly
- **AND** the pairing code remains valid until its normal expiration

#### Scenario: Invalid code cannot probe device names

- **GIVEN** a caller submits invalid code `ZZZZ-ZZZZ`
- **WHEN** the caller submits known name `laptop` or unknown name `guess`
- **THEN** the daemon rejects the code before a device-name lookup
- **AND** both requests use the same unauthorized response

#### Scenario: Concurrent exchange permits one success

- **GIVEN** two requests submit the same valid code concurrently
- **WHEN** the daemon processes both requests
- **THEN** exactly one request can register a device
- **AND** the other request cannot reuse the consumed code

#### Scenario: Code expires during a successful registry write

- **GIVEN** the daemon admits a valid code before its expiration
- **AND** the code reaches its expiration during the registry write
- **WHEN** the registry stores the device
- **THEN** the daemon consumes the admitted code
- **AND** the daemon returns the device token

#### Scenario: Remote HTTP endpoint fails before code input

- **GIVEN** the remote endpoint is `http://remote.example`
- **WHEN** the operator runs `netclaw pair http://remote.example`
- **THEN** the CLI rejects the endpoint before it reads a pairing code
- **AND** the CLI stores no token or endpoint

#### Scenario: Loopback HTTP endpoint remains available

- **GIVEN** the endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:5199`
- **WHEN** the operator runs the normal pair command
- **THEN** the CLI permits the exchange

#### Scenario: Remote redirect cannot export the code

- **GIVEN** the HTTPS exchange endpoint returns a redirect
- **WHEN** the remote CLI submits a pairing code
- **THEN** the CLI does not follow the redirect
- **AND** the CLI stores no token or endpoint

#### Scenario: Invalid remote response fails clearly

- **GIVEN** the remote endpoint times out or returns invalid success JSON
- **WHEN** the remote CLI waits for the exchange result
- **THEN** the CLI returns a clear failure
- **AND** the CLI stores no token or endpoint

#### Scenario: Oversized response stops at the byte boundary

- **GIVEN** an exchange endpoint returns a success or error body larger than 4 KiB
- **WHEN** the CLI reads the body
- **THEN** it stops after at most 4,097 bytes and rejects the response
- **AND** it preserves the prior client token and endpoint

#### Scenario: Small success response remains valid

- **GIVEN** the endpoint returns a valid device-token response within 4 KiB
- **WHEN** the CLI reads the complete response before its deadline
- **THEN** it stores the token and endpoint

#### Scenario: Response stalls after headers

- **GIVEN** the endpoint returns headers but does not finish its body
- **WHEN** the request deadline expires
- **THEN** the CLI cancels the body read and reports failure
- **AND** it preserves the prior client token and endpoint

### Requirement: Paired device registry

The daemon SHALL maintain a registry of paired devices at
`~/.netclaw/config/devices.json`. The registry SHALL store device name, token
hash (NOT the raw token), creation timestamp, and last-used timestamp. The
registry SHALL be readable by the operator via `netclaw daemon devices`.

#### Scenario: List paired devices

- **GIVEN** two devices are paired: `aaron-laptop` and `aaron-desktop`
- **WHEN** the operator runs `netclaw daemon devices`
- **THEN** the output lists both devices with their names, creation dates, and
  last-used timestamps

#### Scenario: Revoke a paired device

- **GIVEN** a device `aaron-laptop` is paired
- **WHEN** the operator runs `netclaw daemon devices revoke aaron-laptop`
- **THEN** the device is removed from the registry
- **AND** the device's token is no longer accepted for authentication

#### Scenario: Last-used timestamp updated on connection

- **GIVEN** a paired device connects with a valid bearer token
- **WHEN** the connection is authenticated
- **THEN** the device's last-used timestamp is updated in the registry

### Requirement: Non-local exposure requires paired device or auth scheme

When the daemon's exposure mode is non-local, startup validation SHALL verify
that at least one paired device exists OR an alternative authentication scheme
(e.g., OIDC) is configured. If neither condition is met, startup SHALL fail.

#### Scenario: Non-local mode with paired devices starts successfully

- **GIVEN** exposure mode is `tailscale-serve`
- **AND** one or more paired devices exist
- **WHEN** the daemon starts
- **THEN** startup succeeds

#### Scenario: Non-local mode with no auth fails startup

- **GIVEN** exposure mode is `tailscale-serve`
- **AND** no paired devices exist
- **AND** no alternative auth scheme is configured
- **WHEN** the daemon starts
- **THEN** startup fails with error indicating no authentication is configured
  for remote access

### Requirement: CLI attaches bearer token for remote connections

The CLI's control-plane clients SHALL read a device token from `~/.netclaw/config/secrets.json` and attach it as a bearer token when connecting to any endpoint that requires remote authentication. Pure local-mode loopback endpoints MAY skip token attachment.

#### Scenario: Remote endpoint with token

- **GIVEN** `Daemon:Endpoint` is `http://remote-host:5199`
- **AND** a device token exists in `secrets.json`
- **WHEN** the CLI connects to the daemon
- **THEN** the bearer token is attached to the SignalR connection

#### Scenario: Local-mode loopback endpoint skips token

- **GIVEN** `Daemon.ExposureMode` is `local`
- **AND** `Daemon:Endpoint` is `http://127.0.0.1:5199`
- **WHEN** the CLI connects to the daemon
- **THEN** no bearer token is attached

#### Scenario: Reverse-proxy loopback endpoint attaches token

- **GIVEN** `Daemon.ExposureMode` is `reverse-proxy`
- **AND** `Daemon:Endpoint` is `http://127.0.0.1:5199`
- **AND** a device token exists in `secrets.json`
- **WHEN** the CLI connects to the daemon
- **THEN** the bearer token is attached
- **AND** the CLI does not assume loopback auth will authorize the connection

#### Scenario: Remote-auth-required endpoint without token fails

- **GIVEN** the resolved daemon endpoint requires remote authentication
- **AND** no device token exists in `secrets.json`
- **WHEN** the CLI attempts to connect
- **THEN** the connection fails with 401
- **AND** the CLI displays a message suggesting `netclaw pair`

### Requirement: Pairing code generation stays daemon-host local

The daemon SHALL generate a five-minute single-use pairing code only through `netclaw daemon pair` and the local-control endpoint.
The SignalR hub SHALL NOT expose pairing code generation.
The daemon SHALL NOT use request source addresses or device bearer tokens as host-origin proof.

#### Scenario: Valid host proof may generate a pairing code

- **GIVEN** any configured exposure mode is active
- **AND** the host CLI submits a valid local-control proof
- **WHEN** `netclaw daemon pair` runs
- **THEN** the daemon creates and returns a pairing code

#### Scenario: Device bearer token does not add host authority

- **GIVEN** a remote device has a valid token for `laptop`
- **AND** it has no local-control proof
- **WHEN** it requests a new pairing code
- **THEN** the daemon returns an unauthorized response
- **AND** it creates no pairing code

#### Scenario: Forwarded loopback traffic does not grant host authority

- **GIVEN** remote tunnel or proxy traffic reaches the daemon through loopback
- **AND** the remote caller has no local-control proof
- **WHEN** the caller requests a pairing code
- **THEN** the daemon rejects the request
- **AND** the daemon creates no pairing code

### Requirement: Device token lifetime and recovery

The device token SHALL remain valid until the operator revokes its device record.
The daemon SHALL NOT require token refresh or automatic token renewal.
A pairing code expiration SHALL NOT change an existing device token.
A client that loses a token SHALL use the normal pairing flow again.

#### Scenario: Pairing code expires after a device pairs

- **GIVEN** device `tablet` has a valid device token
- **AND** the pairing code that created it has expired
- **WHEN** `tablet` authenticates with its device token
- **THEN** the daemon accepts the token
- **AND** the client does not refresh the token

#### Scenario: Lost token requires normal pairing and old-record revocation

- **GIVEN** a client lost its token and its old device record still exists
- **WHEN** the client needs access again
- **THEN** the operator creates a new pairing code on the daemon host
- **AND** the client pairs with a unique replacement name
- **AND** the operator revokes the old device record after replacement access works

#### Scenario: Revoked token can use normal pairing

- **GIVEN** an operator revoked a device token
- **WHEN** the client needs access again
- **THEN** the operator creates a new pairing code on the daemon host
- **AND** the client uses `netclaw pair <endpoint>`

### Requirement: Pairing upgrade preserves durable device state

The upgrade SHALL preserve device records, valid device tokens, and exposure settings.
Operators SHALL update the daemon and host CLI together, then restart the daemon.
The CLI SHALL NOT fall back to the removed hub method.

#### Scenario: Current daemon and CLI pair successfully

- **GIVEN** the operator updated and restarted both components
- **WHEN** the host runs `netclaw daemon pair`
- **THEN** the new local-control flow succeeds
- **AND** previously paired remote devices remain valid

#### Scenario: New CLI with an old daemon gives update guidance

- **GIVEN** the CLI supports local control but the daemon does not
- **WHEN** the host runs `netclaw daemon pair`
- **THEN** the command fails with guidance to update both components
- **AND** the command does not call the legacy hub method

#### Scenario: Old CLI with a new daemon cannot use the removed method

- **GIVEN** the daemon supports local control but the old CLI still uses `GeneratePairingCode`
- **WHEN** the old CLI invokes that hub method
- **THEN** the daemon rejects the invocation because the method does not exist
- **AND** the old CLI can report a missing-method error instead of the new update guidance
- **AND** the daemon creates no code and exposes no compatibility stub

#### Scenario: Host re-authentication uses normal pairing

- **GIVEN** the host has key-ring access but has no valid device token
- **WHEN** another host command requires a device token
- **THEN** the operator can generate a code through local control
- **AND** the operator can pair the host through the normal exchange endpoint
