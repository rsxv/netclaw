# Regression test for the non-root CLI launcher (ADR-004).
#
# The daemon runs as the unprivileged `netclaw` user, but `docker exec` /
# `kubectl exec` default to the image USER (root) — and `netclaw init`, the
# documented first-run setup, is invoked exactly that way. The netclaw CLI is a
# .NET single-file binary that self-extracts into a per-$HOME dir the runtime
# locks to the invoking user (mode 700), and CLI config writes land under
# NETCLAW_HOME. Run as root, both become root-owned and the non-root daemon can
# no longer use them — the agent's own `shell_execute netclaw ...` then fails
# with "Failed to create directory ... Error code: 13" (EACCES, exit 160).
#
# /usr/local/bin/netclaw is therefore a self-dropping launcher that re-execs as
# the netclaw user when invoked as root. This test reproduces the original
# breakage path — a root `docker exec -- netclaw <cmd>` — and asserts:
#
#   Phase A — a root-context CLI invocation succeeds and drops to netclaw:
#     `docker exec` (default user = root) running `netclaw --version` must exit 0
#     and print a version (NOT the EACCES bundle-extraction error).
#
#   Phase B — it leaves NOTHING root-owned under the netclaw home:
#     After root-context CLI runs (incl. the offline `doctor`, which touches
#     config), no path under /home/netclaw/.net or /home/netclaw/.netclaw may be
#     owned by uid 0. Without the launcher the extraction dir is created
#     root:root and this fails — the regression guard.
#
#   Phase C — the non-root path still execs directly:
#     `docker exec -u netclaw` (already the runtime user) must run the CLI without
#     a second drop, exit 0, and keep the extraction dir netclaw-owned.
#
#   Phase D — the daemon stays healthy throughout.
