# Netclaw Operations

This is your operational guide. Load it when the user's request is about
Netclaw itself — what it can do, how to schedule work, how to diagnose
problems, how to update preferences, or how to maintain itself.

## Route by Intent

Safety-critical and high-frequency guidance (tool arguments, large output,
approvals, identity-vs-memory routing) is inline below. Everything else lives in
a reference file — load the one matching the user's intent with
`skill_read_resource`.

## CLI Chat Delivery

A fresh `netclaw chat` creates its session on the first input.
A resume chat attaches when its page opens.
The CLI requires a daemon that advertises text admission version 1.
Upgrade the daemon when the CLI reports unsupported text admission.

Normal Ctrl+Q permits two seconds total for prior input admission.
It does not wait for model completion.
The daemon retains admitted work after the client disconnects.
The CLI prints unresolved delivery status after the terminal UI closes.

Unsent text did not start its input RPC.
Unconfirmed delivery may already exist in the daemon journal.
Check the session before you resend unconfirmed text or an interaction response.
The CLI does not automatically replay an uncertain request.
Do not delete a session solely because its completed turn count is zero.
Forced termination does not provide the normal quit guarantee.

Identity redo waits for the daemon to apply the saved config before guided chat.
A daemon that already runs must report its config generation before the identity save.
A probe failure blocks that save. Retry after the daemon becomes ready.
Esc on the saved screen skips chat and keeps the saved identity.

## Built-in Tools Before the `netclaw` CLI

A built-in tool needs no shell approval. A `netclaw` command through `shell_execute`
needs one, and an unattended run cannot get it. Use the built-in tool when one does
the operation. If the tool is not in your tool list, it is deferred: call
`load_tool(name)`, then call the tool. Call `search_tools(query)` only when you do
not know the name, and wait for its result before a shell call.

| Operation | Built-in tool |
|-----------|---------------|
| Reminders: list, create or change, stop, read run history, test | `list_reminders`, `set_reminder`, `cancel_reminder`, `get_reminder_history`, `run_reminder` |
| Inbound webhooks: list, create or change, delete | `list_webhooks`, `set_webhook`, `delete_webhook` |
| Memories: search, read, save, change or delete | `find_memories`, `get_memories`, `store_memory`, `update_memory` |
| Skills: load, read a bundled file, create or edit or delete | `skill_load`, `skill_read_resource`, `skill_manage` |
| Read `netclaw.json`, the saved shell grants (`tool-approvals.json`), or a log | `file_read` |

A `netclaw` command for an operation in this table, such as `netclaw reminder list`
or `netclaw skill list`, is for a person at a terminal. Do not run it.

Run a `netclaw` command through `shell_execute` only when no built-in tool does the
operation. Common cases: `netclaw status`, `netclaw doctor`,
`netclaw reminder show|status|enable|delete <id>`, `netclaw approvals trust-verb|revoke`
(run `netclaw approvals list` first to get the exact label for a revoke),
`netclaw secrets set`, `netclaw mcp ...`, `netclaw skill sync|validate|issues|source`,
`netclaw sessions`, `netclaw stats`, `netclaw update`, and
`netclaw memory backfill-embeddings`.

## File and Shell Selection

When available, use `file_read` for a known local file read.
When available, use `file_list` for a known local directory listing.
Use `file_search` for bounded recursive name or literal text search.
Use `file_read` for image metadata.
Use `attach_file` with the authorized source path. The tool copies it into the session when necessary.
A linked or protected destination causes a denial. Do not use shell to bypass that denial.
Issue independent `file_read` calls in parallel when several paths are known.
Use `tool_output_read` to continue a spilled result by call id.
When available, use `file_write` or `file_edit` for a known local file change.
When available, use `web_search` for external discovery and `web_fetch` for a known external page.
When available, use `shell_execute` for local search, VCS, builds, tests, processes, or requested shell behavior.
Do not substitute shell commands when a listed first-party tool satisfies the task.
Do not delegate a known file operation that an available file tool can complete.
After a successful file tool result, do not use shell only to verify it unless the user requests shell behavior.
For disposable text, use `file_write` in `temp_dir`, then use `file_read`; do not attempt a shell redirect first.
Standard temporary APIs use `temp_dir` in each shell process.
Use `load_tool` directly for a known exact tool name.
Use `search_tools` when the capability is known but its exact tool name is not.

Keep shell approval friction bounded:

1. Start with the smallest single shell operation that directly answers the request.
2. Use one operation per call. Keep independent searches and diagnostics separate; do not join them with separators or labels.
3. Add a pipeline only when the requested result requires it.
4. Do not use shell only to verify a successful structured tool result.
5. If approval is required but no interactive requester is available, do not retry or substitute the call during that turn.
6. After an access denial, do not retry that call during the same user turn.
7. Do not change its scope or substitute another tool to evade the denial.
8. A later explicit user request can start a new call. Apply the normal approval policy to that call.
9. Apply all compatible advice in a correction response before the next call.
10. A shell call can return correction advice under Auto. Auto removes approval prompts; it does not remove corrections.
11. Advice grants no authority. Every replacement call passes current policy.
12. If you require the exact platform path, retry unchanged once through normal policy.
13. Reviewed diagnostics without file output do not receive temporary relocation advice. Normal approval and denial rules still apply.
14. Write long text (PR bodies, issue bodies, commit messages, file contents) to a file first, then pass the file to the command (for example `gh pr create --body-file <file>`, `gh issue create --body-file <file>`, `git commit -F <file>`). Do not inline long text in a shell command: a command that needs approval and is longer than 900 characters gets a `shorten_shell_command` correction, not a prompt.
15. To send fixed text on stdin, quote the heredoc delimiter (`python3 - <<'EOF'`) or use a literal here string (`<<< 'text'`). Such a call gets the same approval as the same text in an argument (`python3 -c '...'`), so a saved grant can cover it. Put each file redirect before the heredoc operator (`cat > out.txt <<'EOF'`), and put the next command on a new line after the end word. Use only literal arguments with the heredoc. An unquoted delimiter, a here string with a variable, a pipe or `&&` on the operator line, a loop variable in the command, stdin text to a shell (`bash`, `sh`), and an argument that holds a shell name (`ssh host 'bash -s'`, `grep 'run bash now'`) get a one-time prompt.

## Project Directory

`set_working_directory(path)` sets the session's project root (absolute path within
allowed roots); the project's identity file (`.netclaw/AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
`AGENTS.md`, or `CONTEXT.md`) then loads into the prompt. Full rules:
`skill_read_resource('netclaw-operations', 'references/projects.md')`.

Choose directories in this order:

1. For declared-project work, omit `WorkingDirectory`; the shell uses `project_dir`.
2. For one call in a named child directory, set typed `WorkingDirectory`.
3. Use `temp_dir` for disposable files. Standard temporary APIs already use this directory.
4. Use an inline directory change only when the task requests that behavior.

Typed `WorkingDirectory` and absolute operands give exact scope but add no safe-space root.
Program-specific directory options do not replace `WorkingDirectory`.
If shell advice names `use_shell_working_directory`, remove the leading `cd` from a new call.
Set `WorkingDirectory` to the suggested child directory. The original call did not run.
The new call passes normal approval policy.
If the task needs the original shell directory behavior, keep the command and set `WorkingDirectory` to `project_dir`.
That explicit project scope skips repeated advice. The original command still passes normal approval policy.

When available, call `set_working_directory` before the first tool call for
another user-named project.
This rule applies to shell tools, file tools, subagents, and absolute path operands.
Do not repeat the call when `[working-context]` already names that project. If
the tool rejects a path, declare the user-provided fallback before other tools.
Do not probe a named project path before declaring it.
Use the task's first project path exactly; do not substitute its parent first.
Honor a request to keep the current project unchanged.
A denied child-directory call does not permit a project change.

## Managed Session Storage

The `[session]` block separates five paths:

- `session_dir` is the workspace and the relative-path fallback.
- `temp_dir` is run-local storage for disposable files.
- `artifact_dir` is the run-owned output area.
- `worktree_dir` is the session area for Git worktrees.
- `log_path` is the exact raw audit log for the current run.

Use `file_read` to read the exact `log_path` for the current run.
Public and Team cannot access other sessions without explicit configured roots.
Versioned parent and child runs share the current session envelope.
Legacy runs can read their own exact log, but not separate parent or child logs.
Use a legacy child's summary and shared-workspace artifacts instead.
Directory list and search require directory authority; an exact log grants none.
Do not use shell to find session logs.
Normal audience and operation policy applies to every session path.
Attachment copies and fetched files must pass destination checks before Netclaw saves them.
A permitted copy or fetch does not enable general file-write access.
If a save fails, report the tool error; do not claim that the file exists.
Netclaw does not automatically remove managed temporary files or worktrees.

Use `shell_execute` to run Git with a destination below `worktree_dir`.
After Git succeeds, use `set_working_directory` to adopt the created path.
A failed Git command does not change project scope.

For Team and Personal sessions, `[working-context]` is refreshed at the start
of each new turn. In a Git project it includes the active worktree, branch,
HEAD, upstream divergence, and dirty counts. Treat this as turn-start
grounding: a checkout or commit performed during the current tool loop appears
in the next turn's snapshot. If Git is unavailable, the turn continues with an
explicit unavailable status rather than invented repository state. Subagents
receive a read-only project/recent-file snapshot. Successful and partial runs
return only file edits confirmed through their own tools; failed or cancelled
runs contribute no parent working-context changes.

## Scheduling & Background Jobs

Reminders: `set_reminder` with schedule type `once` / `interval` / `cron`. Always
set `delivery_kind` explicitly (`current_session` / `channel` / `none`). A reminder
that fires unattended cannot answer approval prompts, so pre-approve any shell verbs
it needs first with `netclaw approvals trust-verb <verb>`, or test it with
`/run-reminder <id>` (the `run-reminder` skill and the `run_reminder` tool). The
test runs the reminder's exact prompt in the chat, so the user can answer each
prompt with an "Always" grant that the scheduled run reads. The CLI form is
`netclaw reminder run <id>`. The test runs only in a chat at the reminder's
audience, and a CLI chat is Personal (#2330). Background shell: set
`_background: true` on `shell_execute` (max 5 concurrent; cancel servers/watchers
when done; background jobs are killed when the session passivates).

Full detail — delivery contract, proactive channel messaging, approval scoping,
job lifecycle — is in
`skill_read_resource('netclaw-operations', 'references/scheduling.md')`.

## Tool argument validation

Prefer the canonical argument names exactly as a tool declares them, and the
canonical meta keys `_rationale`, `_timeout_seconds`, `_background` (leading
underscore, snake_case). Recognition is spelling-tolerant so a near-miss is
consumed rather than dropped: declared params fold case/punctuation, and the
meta keys also accept the underscore-dropped/cased/shortened forms
(`TimeoutSeconds`, `timeout_seconds`, `Timeout` → the timeout hint; `Rationale`,
`Background` likewise). The supplied value is always *used* — never silently
defaulted.

Every tool call requires a non-empty `_rationale` string. State the call intent
and reason in one sentence. Apply this rule to each parallel call and each later
tool iteration. If a correction reports a missing rationale, fix every call
before the retry.

Three things are still rejected loudly, and when rejected the tool did NOT run —
fix and re-issue once, do not retry the same shape:

- **Unknown keys** — a key that matches no parameter and no meta field rejects
  with a `did you mean '<canonical>'?` suggestion and the list of valid names.
- **Invalid values** — a value that cannot parse as its type (`_timeout_seconds:
  "1200ms"`, `_background: "yes"`) rejects instead of falling back to a default.
- **Ambiguous meta spelling** — supplying two keys that map to the same meta
  field (e.g. both `_timeout_seconds` and `TimeoutSeconds`) rejects; send one.

A repeated action-and-outcome correction means that no requested call ran.
Choose a different action or finish the task from the available evidence.
Do not repeat the blocked batch.
Netclaw disables tools for the turn if the same blocked batch appears again.
Report incomplete work and do not claim that the blocked operation succeeded.
If validation rejects metadata, repair the reported value before the retry.
A valid metadata repair is not the same rejected action. A new user message
starts a fresh cycle window; compaction alone does not.
If a text-only response contains tool calls, Netclaw rejects those calls and reports a provider failure.
This failure does not prove that the turn exhausted its tool budget.

## Large tool output

Netclaw limits each inline tool result to a character budget.
`Session.Tuning.MaxInlineToolResultChars` defaults to 12,000 characters.
`shell_execute` uses 2,000 characters.
A longer result contains only its tail, with a separator before the retained text.
The shell tail retains the process exit status.

- **Each tool, also `skill_load`, `skill_read_resource`, and MCP tools**: Netclaw
  keeps the full redacted result inside the current session. The last line of the
  result names `tool_output_read` and a `CallId`. Use `tool_output_read` with that
  `CallId` and a `Start`/`Limit` window to read the omitted prefix or middle.
  Set `Start=0` to read from the start of the retained result.
  Do not request a path or rerun the source tool to read more.
  If the last line says that Netclaw did not keep the full output, the omitted text is
  not available: narrow the call if the tool has a bound, or read one specific
  resource with `skill_read_resource`.
- **`file_read`** on a large file returns the head and steers you to read a
  specific range with `StartLine`/`Limit` or `grep` (`StartLine` is a 1-based line
  number — line 1 is the first line). Don't `cat` a huge file through
  `shell_execute` to get around it — that just spills again.
- **`background_job`** output goes to `~/.netclaw/jobs/{id}/output.log` (bounded);
  `check_background_job` returns a tail, and you can `file_read`/`grep` the log for the rest.
  Netclaw deletes a terminal job's definition and logs 24 hours after completion.

Use bounded continuation before re-running a command or re-reading a whole file.
Secret-bearing values are redacted from all tool output.

## Tool Discovery

Only a core toolset is always loaded. Use `load_tool(name)` when an exact deferred
tool name is known. Use `search_tools(query)` to find tools by capability when the
name is unknown. Full guidance:
`skill_read_resource('netclaw-operations', 'references/tools.md')`.

MCP servers can also supply workflow skills. These skills use names such as
`mcp__gigatron__month_over_month`. Review the normal skill index first. Use
`skill_load(name, arguments)` when one of these workflows matches the request.

The argument hint marks values that the MCP server requires. Supply those
values exactly. Do not invent a missing value. A loaded prompt can name MCP
tools, but it does not grant them. Use the normal `search_tools` and
`load_tool` flow for each required tool.

### MCP Result Artifacts

An MCP tool can return a file artifact with its text result. Netclaw applies the
same supported file types, magic-byte checks, and size limit as other content.

A verified artifact reaches the user through the normal file-output path. It
also reaches the active model when the media catalog and model modality permit
that input.

A text-only model does not receive image bytes. The result keeps the file for
the user and states the modality limit.

Netclaw rejects invalid, unsupported, or oversized artifact data. The result
keeps readable text and includes a rejection note. Do not decode Base64 from the
tool text or use shell to bypass that rejection.

## MCP OAuth

For HTTP/SSE MCP servers, the Model Context Protocol .NET SDK owns PKCE,
authorization-code exchange, token refresh, and the related HTTP calls. Netclaw
owns protected-resource discovery and dynamic client registration (DCR),
presents the authorization URL, brokers the browser callback, and durably stores
active credentials. Do not fetch metadata or token endpoints by hand, build PKCE
requests, or create or repair `mcp-oauth-metadata.json`; legacy metadata files
are ignored.

Netclaw requests JSON token responses from providers that negotiate the response
format, including GitHub. This request keeps the response compatible with the
MCP SDK token decoder.

Netclaw registers rather than letting the SDK do it because the SDK hard-codes
`token_endpoint_auth_method: "client_secret_post"` and ignores what the
authorization server advertises, which fails against servers that accept public
clients only. Netclaw registers with the method the server advertises first.
Registration happens only during `netclaw mcp auth <name>`, never on a
background reconnect.

### Authorize a server

Run this with the daemon active:

```bash
netclaw mcp auth <name>
```

The command starts an unpublished client candidate, opens the authorization URL
when possible, always prints it, and waits up to five minutes. Complete the
browser flow normally. If the callback cannot reach this machine, paste the full
redirect URL into the command. Netclaw keeps exchanged credentials local to the
candidate, then commits them once and publishes the client only after tool
discovery succeeds. A failed replacement does not alter durable credentials or
displace an existing healthy connection.

The SDK redirect URI is
`http://127.0.0.1:{Daemon.Port}/api/mcp/oauth/callback`. If the provider requires
a pre-registered redirect URI, use the configured `Daemon.Port`, not a fixed
default port.

Some providers require a pre-registered confidential client.
Caution: command arguments can appear in process inspection and shell history.
Run the next command only on a trusted host.

```bash
netclaw mcp add --transport http --client-id <id> --client-secret <secret> <name> <url>
```

Netclaw stores the secret in encrypted configuration.
Do not put the secret in `netclaw.json`.
A client ID without a secret remains valid for public clients.
The configured identity stays authoritative during token exchange, refresh, and daemon restart.

A configured `Authorization` header takes precedence over SDK OAuth. Netclaw
sends that header unchanged, does not start SDK OAuth after a challenge, and
rejects `netclaw mcp auth <name>` until the header is removed. Check or rotate the
configured header instead of trying to layer OAuth on top of it.

OAuth credentials are bound to the server's canonical configured resource
identity. If the same profile name is pointed at another resource, Netclaw
withholds its old tokens and dynamically registered client credentials, reports
`AwaitingAuth`, and preserves the old durable record until replacement succeeds.

A token record written before resource binding existed is migrated in place when
its legacy resource describes the configured endpoint, so upgrading does not
force reauthorization. A trailing slash, path case, and a bare-origin resource
indicator all still match; a different scheme, host, port, query, or sibling path
does not, and those report `AwaitingAuth` with both bindings written to the
daemon log. An explicitly configured static OAuth client ID remains
authoritative.

If a server rejects the stored client identity as `invalid_client` — usually
because the registration was deleted on their side — Netclaw discards that
identity, keeps the tokens, and registers a new client on the next
`netclaw mcp auth <name>`. No manual cleanup is needed.

If a server's authorization server publishes no `registration_endpoint`, or
rejects registration, the error names the remedy: register a client manually
with that provider and set it with `netclaw mcp add --client-id <id> ...`.

### Read connection states

| State | Meaning and action |
|-------|--------------------|
| `Connected` | A usable client generation is published. The status includes its discovered tool count. |
| `AwaitingAuth` | No usable OAuth credential is bound to this resource, or an access token expired without a refresh token. Run `netclaw mcp auth <name>`. Startup and background reconnects never open a browser or block. |
| `AuthFailed` | The server rejected credentials that were supplied. Reauthorize SDK-managed OAuth, or check the configured `Authorization` header if it owns auth. |
| `Unreachable` | A non-auth transport, network, timeout, or initialization failure prevented connection. Check the endpoint and daemon logs. |

### Read catalog refresh health

The daemon marks a connected server degraded after three consecutive catalog
refresh failures. The connection state stays `Connected`.
`/api/mcp/statuses` reports `degraded: true`, and `netclaw status` reports
`degraded`. `netclaw mcp list` and `netclaw doctor` report
`connected but not responding` with the cached tool count. The doctor check
returns `Warning`.

A healthy server uses a catalog poll interval of five minutes. After consecutive
failures, the minimum retry intervals are 30, 60, 120, 240, and 300 seconds.
The poll runs every 30 seconds and can delay an attempt beyond its minimum
interval. A successful refresh or reconnect clears the failure count and
restores the interval of five minutes. Caller cancellation, daemon shutdown,
and lease deactivation do not increase the failure count. Diagnostics retain the
last refresh failure timestamp after recovery.

Cached tools stay published and callable while catalog refreshes fail. A
degraded status does not block tool calls, so a call can still time out.
Check the endpoint and daemon logs before you repeat a call. The daemon reports
expected timeout and transport failures without a stack trace. Unexpected
failures keep their stack trace.

At startup, the daemon connects enabled MCP servers concurrently. It waits
for each initial attempt before it reports ready. A failed server has its own
status; other server tools remain available. Use `netclaw mcp list` to inspect
each result.

### Diagnose failures

```bash
netclaw mcp list    # configured servers plus live daemon connection states
netclaw doctor      # MCP config and health checks
netclaw status      # daemon connector health, including MCP
```

`netclaw doctor` uses live daemon state when available. If the daemon is down, it
can probe connectivity but cannot verify SDK-managed OAuth; start the daemon for
an authoritative auth result.

OAuth failures return safe structured errors with an `error`, an `operation`,
and, when known, an HTTP `status`. The CLI prints the useful message rather than
raw JSON. A blank provider body still produces a structured daemon error from its
HTTP status. If the daemon response body is blank or malformed, the CLI falls
back to `HTTP <code> <reason>` instead of showing an empty error. Check daemon
logs for full server context; operator-facing errors omit authorization codes,
tokens, PKCE data, and client secrets.

Credential persistence fails loudly. If the durable secrets write fails,
authorization fails, active credentials do not change, and the candidate is not
published. Fix the filesystem or secrets-store error shown in daemon logs, then
run `netclaw mcp auth <name>` again; browser success alone does not mean the MCP
connection is ready.

## Approval Prompts

MCP approval prompts show a bounded, redacted preview of the call arguments.
Actual path- and URL-shaped values appear first and receive a larger preview so
the operator can verify location context without guessing from argument names.
URL credentials, query values, and fragments are redacted.
Large strings, binary data, and nested collections are summarized by size;
secret-like fields and token-shaped values are always redacted. Argument names
and values are escaped before display so server-controlled schema text cannot
break or spoof the approval prompt. MCP grants are tool-wide rather than
directory-scoped, so these prompts omit the misleading `Always here` option and
label the persistent choice `Always allow this tool` rather than the
shell-oriented `Always anywhere`. Other non-shell tools also omit `Always here`
because their approval matchers do not consume directory scope.

After a person approves a prompt, the tool result ends with one line that
names the choice, for example `[approval: once]` or
`[approval: always in this folder]`. `once` and `this chat only` do not carry
over to another session. A scheduled reminder run is another session.

Shell approvals store a typed phrase and a scope in `tool-approvals.json`:

- **verb** — the command words of the call: the program and its plain words
  (e.g. `git push`, `pipedrive dealFields list`, `grep needle`). No flags, no
  path arguments. The prompt shows the same words that the answer saves. So
  `pipedrive dealFields list --json` shows and saves
  `pipedrive dealFields list`, not `pipedrive`.
  A phrase of two or more words names a verb. It covers its command words and
  any later command words, which are arguments: `git push` covers
  `git push origin main`, and `dotnet package search` covers each package.
  A phrase of one word names only the program and covers that word alone:
  `gh` covers `gh --help`, not `gh auth logout`. A word of the phrase is never
  free: `git push upstream` does not cover `git push origin main`. A new grant
  saves the words of the approved call, and the prompt shows those words. A
  call with other words (`pipedrive organizationFields list`) gets its own
  prompt.
- **directory** — the path field for folder and global grants. Netclaw sets it from:
  - **Path argument** in the original command (`find /repo`, `ls /var/log`,
    `cat ~/.bashrc`). The path argument is the directory; for file targets
    the parent directory is used so `cat ~/.bashrc` scopes to `~`.
  - **Cwd** when no path argument is present (`git status`, `freshdesk`).
  - **`null`** for the global wildcard ("approve this verb in any
    directory") — only set by `Always anywhere`.

A program path names a file, not a spelling. When the program word has a
slash (`./tool`, `../bin/tool`, `/opt/bin/tool`), the grant stores the
absolute path of the file. Netclaw joins a relative path with the working
directory of that command, after each `cd`. So `cd ~/.dotnet/tools &&
./ilspycmd` and `/home/user/.dotnet/tools/ilspycmd` use one grant, and
`./ilspycmd` in another folder needs its own approval. A bare name such as
`dotnet` does not change. A program that starts with `~/` gets a correction:
write the full path of the program instead. A `This repository` grant stores
a repository program by its path below the worktree root
(`./scripts/build.sh`), so it covers that file in each worktree.

Older grants saved the spelling. Netclaw reads `~/x` and `/abs/x` grants as
the absolute path, and joins a folder grant's `./x` with its folder. A `./x`
grant with no folder keeps its old reach, and `netclaw approvals list` and
`netclaw doctor` show it as a `legacy program spelling`. Revoke it and approve
the program again to cover one file.
A word that names an existing file or folder in the command's directory is
not a command word, unless it is the program or the first word after it. So
`dotnet build Phobos.slnx` uses the `dotnet build` grant, and a new grant
never stores a file name. A word that names a link stays a command word.
Netclaw denies the call when the link target is a protected path. The store also skips a grant that a saved
grant already covers: a saved `git push` grant covers a new `git push upstream`
grant. `netclaw doctor --fix` removes a grant that another grant
covers. It reports and keeps a folder grant that names a file of its folder
and a grant whose folder is gone. It never touches an "anywhere" grant for a
file-like word.
An older exact-phrase grant uses the same rule for its words. The grant
`dotnet list package` covers `dotnet list package --vulnerable`, even when the
prompt shows `dotnet list`.

`This repository` stores a distinct Git repository scope. It applies to
registered worktrees of one repository. Netclaw derives this scope from each
grant-bearing command candidate. The request directory supplies scope only
when a candidate has no directory. Netclaw checks Git registration for each
use. A folder grant keeps its path scope. An unapproved verb or a path outside
the repository still needs approval.
The scope supports an ordinary `.git` directory and registered linked worktrees.
A main checkout with `--separate-git-dir` does not receive this choice.

**Folder-scoped trust compounds.** An entry on `(find, /home/user/repo)`
auto-allows `find /home/user/repo/.netclaw -name X` because the candidate's
extracted path is under the entry's directory. You don't have to call
`set_working_directory` for this — running a command with a path argument
declares scope implicitly.

For a complete static Bash list with an exact directory change, Netclaw checks
each command in each reachable exact directory. A failed `cd` can leave a later
command in the original directory. Each unapproved verb still needs approval.
Dynamic effects and linked directories retain exact approval.

Netclaw can reuse an approval for a bounded shell assignment.
The grant stores a digest of the exact assignment facts.
It does not store the assignment name or value.
A changed assignment needs a separate approval.
An unqualified grant cannot cover an assignment-qualified command.
The reviewed-safe list does not cover an assignment-qualified command.
An incomplete assignment gets only `Once` and `Deny`.
On a Bash 5.2 or 5.3 host, an assignment that stays in the shell does not
qualify a command (decision F3). Netclaw gives the parser the names of the
daemon environment, never the values. An assignment stays in the shell when
the source does not export it and the daemon environment does not hold the
name: `b=$(git branch --show-current); git fetch origin` needs only a grant
for `git fetch`. An assignment still qualifies the command after `export b`,
as a prefix (`b=1 env`), or to a name that the environment holds
(`GIT_DIR=/x; git status`). `set -a` gets only `Once` and `Deny`. An output
command (`echo`, `printf`) keeps every assignment.
A name with a run-time value (`PID=$!`, `x=$(cmd)`, `read x`) is unknown, so a
command that reads it as a word gets only `Once` and `Deny`.
A word that reads a bound value (`x=/etc/app.conf; cat "$x"`) gets the
decision of the literal value, so a protected path or a hard-deny form stays
denied.
A quote or a backslash before the `=` of an option word does not change the
word that the program gets. `tar --file'='../x`, `tar --file\=../x`, and
`tar "--file=../x"` get the option, the value, and the path of
`tar --file=../x`, so a folder grant does not cover a path outside the folder.
`awk -F'[= ]' '{print $2}' f` is a normal command with reusable choices.
An option word with an expansion and no proved value (`-o"$n"`, `--$n=x`) is
an unknown operand.

On Linux, a glob word (`ls -d ~/repositories/*/akka*`) reaches the paths below
its covering directory, and that directory is its scope. A glob that can match
a protected path or the credential store (`~/.netclaw/keys`,
`~/.netclaw/config/secrets.json`) is denied, as the literal path is. A glob
whose first segment is a wildcard (`*/notes.md`) can expand to an option, so
only a safe phrase or an `Always anywhere` grant covers it. Commands inside
`if`, `case`, `while`, `until`, and a background list (`server &`) each get
their own decision.

The approval gate runs three layers in order:

The directory order reserves `temp_dir` for disposable output.
Preserve an explicitly required platform temporary path.
Netclaw does not automatically clean managed temporary storage yet.

1. **Hard-deny list** — system-protected paths and self-destructive commands.
   Always blocks. A process kill is blocked only when it names the Netclaw
   daemon (`pkill netclawd`); stopping a test server you started
   (`pkill -f 'http.server 8899'`) prompts like any other command.
2. **Safe-verb short-circuit** — in an interactive session, when the verb is
   on the curated safe list AND your audience may read every path of the call
   with a file tool, the call auto-runs with no prompt. A protected path never
   qualifies. The list covers demonstrably read-only verbs: file readers
   (`ls`, `grep`, `cat`, …), system/info verbs (`date`, `whoami`, `uname`,
   `uptime`, …), and read-only `git`/`gh` queries (`git status`, `git log`,
   `gh pr view`, `gh run list`, …). Mutating verbs (`git push`, `git fetch`,
   `rm`, `sed -i`), command-prefixing verbs (`env`, `xargs`, `sudo`),
   network-writing verbs (`gh api`, `curl`), and environment/process-inspection
   verbs (`printenv`, `ps`) are never on the list — the safe-space gate
   cannot scope a verb that dumps the environment or the process table.
3. **Interactive prompt** — everything else. A registered worktree can show six choices:
   - **Once** — run this one time, persist nothing.
   - **This chat** — allow the verbs in this directory for the rest of the
     session.
   - **Always here** — persist `(verb, effective directory)`. The
     "directory" is the command's path argument when present, else cwd.
   - **This repository** — persist a grant for this Git repository.
     Registered sibling worktrees can use it for the same phrase.
   - **Always anywhere** — persist `(verb, null)` global wildcard.
     Danger style.
   - **Deny** — refuse this call only.

**Side-effect-only clauses are authorized but not persisted.** When a
compound command includes pure side-effect verbs (`echo`, `printf`, `:`,
`true`, `false`) with no path argument and no redirect, those clauses are
authorized for the current call by the click but no `ApprovalEntry` is
written for them. Recording every literal `echo "==="` would be noise.
A dynamic operand of these verbs is data: `echo "head: $(git rev-parse HEAD)"`
keeps reusable candidates, and the command inside `$(...)` gets its own. A
value from `$(...)` or `read` is data too when the shell cannot glob the word:
in `n=$(cmd); echo "$n"` or `echo pre"$n"`, only `cmd` needs approval.
Unquoted, `n=$(cmd); echo $n` needs consent. `echo $((1 + 2))` and
`echo $(cmd)` are data (only `cmd` needs approval). In Bash, `test` and `[` need no approval when each operand is a
literal or a proved value without `[`: `[ 3 -gt 2 ]`, `x=3; [ "$x" -gt 2 ]`,
and a guard on a loop over literal words. A test on a value from `$(...)` or
`read`, an environment value (`[ -n "$FOO" ]`), or a file name from a glob
loop gets a one-time prompt.
`continue`, `break`, `exit`, and `return` need no approval. These rules also
apply after `cd dir && action;`, where the directory is not known: `echo "---"`
there needs no approval, but a redirect or an unquoted `echo $n` still needs
consent. For a program that
can open files, such as `cat`, a word that the shell can glob and whose value
Netclaw cannot prove (`$f`, `/work/$f`, `~/notes/{a,b}.txt`) makes its command
exact; no grant covers it. When a rewrite can remove the word (a brace list or
a loop over literal words), you get a "write the command words literally"
correction, and the call does not run. Netclaw sends that correction only
when you can make the rewrite. A word with a run-time value (`"$FOO"`,
`$(cmd)`, `$?`, a glob loop value) in a command-word position gets a one-time
prompt with `Once` and `Deny` instead. No grant covers it, and an unattended
run denies it. When the command words are known and
the unquoted word comes after them, as in
`git rev-list --count HEAD...origin/$(git branch --show-current)`, you get a
quote correction that names the word, and the call does not run. Put the word
in double quotes (`"HEAD...origin/$(git branch --show-current)"`) and call
again: a grant for anywhere for the command words then covers it. A value from
`$(...)` or `read` in the verb slot (`f=$(cmd); cat /work/$f`) gets one exact
prompt with `Once` and `Deny`. Write such paths literally. `echo`, `printf`, `test`, and `[` keep their own rules. An ANSI-C word such as
`$'\x6beys'` gets the decision of its decoded text.

**A command that runs no program needs no approval of its own.** An
assignment (`x=1`), a command with only redirects (`> out.json`), and an
output or test command (`echo`, `printf`, `:`, `true`, `false`, `test`) run no
program. The only effect of such a command is its redirects. Each redirect
gets the decision of the file tool for your audience and that path: a write
target (`>`, `>>`, `&>`) gets the `file_write` decision, and an input target
(`<`) gets the `file_read` decision. When the tool can use the path with no
prompt, the command runs with no prompt and no grant:
`printf 'a\n' > drafts/h.tsv && : > drafts/h.json` runs. When the path rules
or a `Deny` mode refuse the target, the call is denied. Examples are
`~/.netclaw/config/secrets.json` and a path outside the trusted roots. Write
the file in an allowed folder instead. When the file tool needs approval, a
saved grant of that tool covers the redirect too. With no such grant, you get
one prompt that names each file ("write /path/out.json"), with `Once` and
`Deny`. That prompt saves nothing, so it repeats: use `file_write`, and save
its approval, to stop it. A program still needs its own approval: `date > out.txt` and
`tee out.txt < in.txt` prompt, and so does `cmd` in `echo $(cmd) > out.txt`.
These forms keep a prompt with `Once` and `Deny` that shows the command text:
a target that Netclaw cannot prove as one file (`> "$f"`, `> *.json`,
`> /dev/tcp/host/port`, a loop variable in the target, a target behind a
link; on macOS also `/var` and the default `TMPDIR`), a redirect after `cd dir;` (use `cd dir && ...` or an absolute target),
the operators `>|`, `>&`, and `<>`, and `x=1 y=2`, `a=(1 2)`, or `x+=1`. A
prompt never shows an empty name. For an unknown program word (`$cmd > x`,
`eval x`), it shows the full command text.

**Prompts survive passivation and restart.** Pending approval prompts are
journaled with their requester and trust context, so if the session goes idle or
the daemon restarts before the user clicks, the click is still honored when it
arrives. Completed sibling tool results are journaled per call, so recovery
re-drives unresolved calls rather than replaying the whole batch. The only case
where a click does nothing is a genuinely expired prompt (the turn already
failed or was superseded); the session then posts a visible "approval prompt has
expired" notice rather than silently dropping the click. If a user reports a
stale button, ask them to re-issue the request.

During a graceful stop, the session can stop a tool task that waits only for
journaled approval prompts. The session waits for that task to stop before it
acknowledges drain. The daemon keeps the existing approval prompt. The original
requester can approve it after restart. They can use its button or a text response. The UI
can temporarily lag the session state. Shutdown cancellation does not mean
the approval expired.
An active tool with a possible external effect keeps the bounded drain path.

An interrupted model call can create a short-lived restart reminder. The
session restores accepted input and its original authority from the journal.
The reminder expires ten minutes after the interruption. A completed turn,
partial reply, or possible tool effect does not create this reminder.

**Why you may not see a prompt at all.** If the user invokes a read-only verb
(say `grep`) on a path that the audience may read, the safe-verb
short-circuit applies in an interactive session and there is no prompt. This
is intended behavior. Mutating verbs in the same directory still prompt.

**When the prompt offers fewer buttons.** Two cases:

- **Unresolved commands** get only `Once` and `Deny`.
  These commands include dynamic assignments and unknown path facts.
  The matcher cannot extract a complete reusable identity. In an interactive
  Bash call, only the unresolved command is shown, as its exact text; the
  other commands keep their grants. A command whose only unknown part is an
  operand runs under a safe phrase or an `Always anywhere` grant (decision D1).
  A variable word with an unknown value is such an operand
  (`for n in $(gh issue list); do gh api "x/$n"; done`).
  A loop over literal values, or a word with one known value, gets the
  decision of each literal command (decision F1). In
  `for n in 8250 8244; do gh api repos/o/r/issues/$n; done`, Netclaw checks
  `gh api repos/o/r/issues/8250` and `gh api repos/o/r/issues/8244` as if you
  typed them. The prompt offers the normal choices, and a chat or folder
  grant for `gh api` covers the next run of the loop. One literal command
  that is denied denies the call. A literal path keeps its scope, so a folder
  grant does not cover `for d in ../x; do dotnet build "$d"; done` or
  `d=../x; dotnet build "$d"`. A program word from a value
  (`for p in /bin/rm; do $p x; done`) gets no literal command.
  Multi-line `python3 -c` code is not unresolved: its scope is the working
  directory, so the prompt offers reusable grants.
  An API route such as `gh api /repos/o/r/...` is not a folder: a word below a
  top-level directory that does not exist uses the working directory scope.
  An option value is a path too: a folder grant for `dotnet build` does not
  cover `dotnet build --output=../x` or `--output=$HOME/x`. Write the output
  path inside the folder, or ask for `This chat` or `Always anywhere`.
- **Shallow cwd** (e.g. `/etc/`, `/`) hides `Always here` only. Persisting a
  too-shallow root would grant the verb across most of the filesystem;
  `This chat` and `Always anywhere` remain available.

If a user keeps getting prompted on read-only verbs, the likely cause is an
unresolved command, a write redirect, or an option before the verb
(`git -C dir status`). Prefer `WorkingDirectory` over `-C`. If they keep getting prompted for the same mutating
verb (e.g. `git push`), suggest `Always here` to persist
`(git push, effective directory)`.

When you check repeated prompts, read the daemon log. Netclaw has no separate
tool audit store. Each decision logs `Tool authorization evaluated: <tool>
outcome=<outcome>` with an `authorizationAttemptId`; a denial also logs
`reason=`. Each shell decision logs ordered `Shell policy trace:` rows. A row
for a covered candidate names its coverage, for example `PersistentFolder`. If
the daemon prompts despite a same-verb saved grant, the `StoredGrantMatch` row
gives the near-miss reason (`TokenMismatch`, `ShellMismatch`,
`OutsideDirectory`, or `Symlink`) and the grant creation time. The trace never
holds raw paths or arguments.

### Inspecting, revoking, and pre-approving grants

To read the saved grants, call `file_read` on `~/.netclaw/config/tool-approvals.json`.
To change a grant, use the `netclaw approvals` CLI; you cannot write that file.
A revoke needs the exact label that `netclaw approvals list` prints, so run `list`
before a revoke. The daemon reads the file on every approval check, so
mutations take effect on the next prompt without a daemon restart.

You may read each file under `~/.netclaw/config/` with `file_read`, for example
`netclaw.json`, `tool-approvals.json`, and `hard-deny-overrides.json`. You
cannot write them, and you cannot read `secrets.json`, the webhook route files
in `~/.netclaw/config/webhooks/`, or `~/.netclaw/keys`.
In the shell, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `grep`, `jq`, and `diff` can read a
config file by its exact path argument. A glob, a brace word
(`{a,b}.json`), a recursive search of the config directory, the config path
inside program text (a `jq` or `python3 -c` program), or a write to a config
file is denied. A `jq` filter with a brace (`jq '{a: .x}' file`) is denied
too; use `cat file | jq '{a: .x}'`. `file_read` always works.

```bash
# Interactive TUI: see everything grouped by audience and tool
netclaw approvals

# List — human-readable. Entries print as "<verb> in <dir>" or "<verb> anywhere",
# each followed by when the grant was added ("added 3 days ago"; "added —" for
# grants saved before timestamps were tracked).
netclaw approvals list
netclaw approvals list --audience personal --tool shell_execute

# Scriptable JSON output (audiences → tools → typed entries)
netclaw approvals list --json

# Revoke by user-visible form (the same labels list emits)
netclaw approvals revoke "git remote in /home/user/repos/foo/"
netclaw approvals revoke "freshdesk anywhere"

# Pre-approve a verb as a global wildcard for unattended/scheduled tasks
netclaw approvals trust-verb freshdesk
netclaw approvals trust-verb gh --audience team

# Clear every entry for a tool (optionally scoped to one audience)
netclaw approvals revoke --tool shell_execute --all
netclaw approvals revoke --tool shell_execute --all --audience personal
```

`revoke` of a non-existent pattern exits non-zero with a clear message — the
CLI never silently succeeds. `trust-verb` is idempotent — re-running it on an
existing entry exits zero with "no changes."

### Pre-approving for unattended tasks (load-bearing)

Reminders and webhooks fire without a human present and cannot answer prompts.
When you (the agent) are helping the user set up an unattended task that needs
shell commands, **identify the verbs the task will need and proactively suggest
pre-approving them as global wildcards** before the schedule fires.

Example dialogue when the user asks you to schedule a daily Freshdesk report:

> "I'll set up a daily reminder that calls `freshdesk --since=24h`. Since
> reminders run unattended and can't prompt for approval, I need to pre-approve
> the `freshdesk` verb globally — that's a `(freshdesk, null)` entry, meaning
> it will auto-allow in any cwd. Mind if I do that with
> `netclaw approvals trust-verb freshdesk`?"

On confirmation, run the trust-verb command via `shell_execute`, then create
the reminder. The grant persists across daemon restarts.

An unattended task uses the same rules as a chat of the same audience: the
same file reach, reviewed-safe catalog, and grants. The one difference: a call
that would prompt in a chat is denied with `approval_required_unattended`,
because nobody can answer. Suggest an "Always" grant for that call in a chat
with the same audience (for a reminder, `/run-reminder <id>`). A grant never
opens a protected path (the config directory, secrets, or keys), and Auto mode
does not use grants.

### Last-resort recovery

If the approval file gets corrupted (the daemon will quarantine it to
`tool-approvals.json.invalid` and warn loudly), or if a v1 store gets detected
during upgrade (the daemon quarantines it to `tool-approvals.json.v1.bak`),
the active file is reset and the v2 store starts empty.

To wipe every persistent grant and start clean, delete the file directly:

macOS/Linux:

```bash
rm ~/.netclaw/config/tool-approvals.json
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item "$HOME/.netclaw/config/tool-approvals.json" -Force
```

Restart the daemon so in-memory session approvals are cleared too.

## Skill Management

Skills load on demand; manage skills and sources via the skill tools. Full guidance:
`skill_read_resource('netclaw-operations', 'references/skills.md')`.

## Webhooks & Inbound Attachments

Inbound webhooks are configured per route; route files are secret-bearing and
protected. Attachment handling is covered alongside. Full setup + rules:
`skill_read_resource('netclaw-operations', 'references/webhooks.md')`.

## Secret Management

Secrets live in `~/.netclaw/config/secrets.json` — **never print raw secret values**
in chat, issues, PRs, or logs. Set them via CLI (`netclaw secrets set <Path> <value>`),
never by direct file edit. Protected paths (`secrets.json`, `.netclaw/keys`,
`config/webhooks`) are always access-denied. A write to the config directory,
including the grant store `tool-approvals.json`, is always denied. The skill
folders (`~/.netclaw/skills/.system`, `~/.netclaw/skills/.server-feeds`) are not
protected, except the feed `.sync-state.json` files. You can run a bundled
skill script with `bash <path>` from `skill_read_resource`. Do not copy it to
another folder first. Full rotation guidance:
`skill_read_resource('netclaw-operations', 'references/secrets.md')`.

## LLM & Search Providers

Add or switch model providers (including OAuth login) and configure search backends
(e.g. SearXNG) via provider config. Full setup:
`skill_read_resource('netclaw-operations', 'references/providers.md')`.

## Tool Lists in Config

A list under `Tools` in `netclaw.json` replaces the built-in default list. It does not
add to it. This applies to `AllowedTools`, `ReadFiles`/`WriteFiles`/`AttachFiles` `Roots`,
`ChannelAttachments.AllowedCategories`, `GlobalReadRoots`, and `WebFetch.HttpAllowList`.

- To add one entry, write the complete list with the defaults. For example, to add
  `/srv/docs` to `GlobalReadRoots`, write
  `["{skills_dir}", "{identity_dir}", "{workspaces_dir}", "/srv/docs"]`.
  `["/srv/docs"]` alone removes the skills, identity, and workspaces roots.
- An absent key keeps the defaults. `[]`, `null`, and `{}` give an empty list.
- The daemon stops at startup when a list key has a scalar value, when an attachment
  category is not valid, or when an empty `NETCLAW_*` variable and a config file both set
  the same list. The error names the key.
- A Public or Team `AllowedTools` list that exactly matches an older Netclaw default gets
  today's default, with a startup warning. Any other list is applied as written, which
  includes an edited older list. If such a list lacks `file_search` or `tool_output_read`,
  add them by hand.
- `netclaw doctor` reports a list that exactly matches any Netclaw default, which includes
  today's default. `netclaw doctor --fix` backs up `netclaw.json`, then deletes that
  `AllowedTools` key, so the audience follows the default in later releases.
- `netclaw doctor` warns when a Public or Team allowlist does not include
  `tool_output_read`. A spilled tool result tells the model to call that tool. The warning
  has no auto-fix, because a narrow list can be intentional.
- `netclaw doctor` warns when the Personal profile has `McpServersMode: Allowlist` and
  an enabled MCP server is not in `AllowedMcpServers`. The Personal audience cannot use
  that server. `netclaw mcp permissions` in 0.27.1-beta.1 and earlier wrote such a list
  when the operator enabled one server. The warning has no auto-fix, because the list can
  be intentional. To repair it, enable the server in `netclaw mcp permissions`, or delete
  `McpServersMode` and `AllowedMcpServers` from the Personal profile.
- `netclaw mcp tools` stops with an error when the `Tools` section is not valid. Fix the
  key that the error names, then run the command again.
- An absent `Security.DeploymentPosture` means the Public posture, unless
  `Security.StrictDefaults` is `false`. The daemon and the `netclaw config` screens use
  the same rule.
- The daemon reads `netclaw.json`, `secrets.json`, and `NETCLAW_*` variables.
  `netclaw doctor`, `netclaw mcp permissions`, `netclaw mcp tools`, and the
  `netclaw config` screens read only `netclaw.json`, so they can show a different value.
- `netclaw init` writes only the posture (`Security.DeploymentPosture`,
  `Security.ShellExecutionMode`, `Security.StrictDefaults`) and `Tools.ShellMode`. It does
  not write `Tools.AudienceProfiles`. The daemon computes the profiles from the posture. An
  absent profile is normal and gets the posture default. For the Personal posture, that
  default requires approval for `shell_execute` on Personal.
- Do not write a default list into `netclaw.json` to "make it visible". Write only the key
  that you change.

## Diagnostics, Kill Switches & Self-Maintenance

Headless `COMPACTION` records expose `summarized` and `tool_results_cleared` phase evidence.
A true summary flag does not prove that the summary retains every task requirement.
Older daemon or CLI versions can omit these flags from the transport and report false.
Check the actor log before you conclude that an older run skipped a phase.

When something is broken, start with `netclaw status`, then `netclaw doctor`. Feature
kill switches and self-update/health are covered in the reference. Memory embeddings
can be backfilled with `netclaw memory backfill-embeddings [--force]` (a no-op while
`Memory.Embeddings.Enabled` is false); doctor checks
memory embedding availability. Full guidance:
`skill_read_resource('netclaw-operations', 'references/diagnostics.md')`.

## Identity

Your identity is defined by layered files loaded into the session prompt:

| Layer | Source | Audience |
|-------|--------|----------|
| SOUL.md | `~/.netclaw/identity/SOUL.md` (filesystem) | All |
| AGENTS.md | Embedded in the Netclaw binary (audience-specific) | Team/Personal get full version; Public gets stripped version |
| TOOLING.md | `~/.netclaw/identity/TOOLING.md` (filesystem) | Team/Personal only |
| Project instructions | `.netclaw/AGENTS.md` etc. in project directory | Team/Personal only |

**AGENTS.md is binary-owned.** The full AGENTS (Team/Personal) contains operating
rules, autonomy guidance, grounding, search policy, scheduling, background shell,
subagent delegation, skill reference, identity file paths, and memory triage. The
Public AGENTS contains only basic operating rules, autonomy, grounding, and media
attachment guidance.

SOUL.md and TOOLING.md remain editable on disk:
- To edit: read the file first with `file_read`, then write with `file_write`.
- Detail subdirectories: `identity/soul/`, `identity/tooling/`.

**Identity vs memory — what goes where:**

- **Identity files define the agent**: persona, tone, communication style, operating
  rules, and the foundational user grounding set at init (the user's name, timezone).
  Edit these only to change *how the agent itself operates*.
- **Durable facts and preferences about the user** learned or stated over time
  (favorite things, family, history, working preferences) → **memory**
  (`store_memory`); they are recalled when relevant. A user asking you to "remember"
  a preference is a memory write, **not** a SOUL.md edit.

When unsure: does it change who the agent *is* or how it operates? → identity file.
Is it a fact about the user to recall later? → memory.
