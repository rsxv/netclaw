# Scheduling & Background Jobs

Scheduling is gated on `Scheduling.Enabled` in `netclaw.json` (default `true`).
When disabled, reminder tools are hidden, `ReminderManagerActor` skips startup
reconciliation, and fired reminders are acknowledged but not executed. Public
audience sessions cannot use scheduling tools regardless of the config flag.

Use the reminder tools, not the `netclaw reminder` commands in the third column.
Those commands are for a person at a terminal, and each one needs a shell approval.
The tools are deferred: call `load_tool(name)` first.

| Operation | Tool and arguments | Operator command |
|-----------|--------------------|------------------|
| List reminders; read a schedule, a status, or the next fire time | `list_reminders` (`Filter`: `active` or `all`; `all` adds disabled reminders) | `netclaw reminder list` |
| Create or change a reminder | `set_reminder` (see below) | none |
| Stop a reminder (disable it) | `cancel_reminder` (`ReminderId`) | `netclaw reminder cancel <id>` |
| Read the run history | `get_reminder_history` (`ReminderId`, optional `Last`) | `netclaw reminder history <id>` |
| Test a reminder in this chat | `run_reminder` (`Id`) | `netclaw reminder run <id>` |

No tool reads the instructions or the delivery of a reminder, reads its retry state,
enables it again, or deletes it. For those operations, run
`netclaw reminder show|status|enable|delete <id>` through `shell_execute`.

`set_reminder` accepts three schedule types:

| Type | Examples |
|------|---------|
| `once` | `"30m"`, `"2h"`, `"2026-03-15T14:30:00Z"` |
| `interval` | `"30m"`, `"6h"`, `"1d"` |
| `cron` | `"0 */6 * * *"`, `"0 9 * * MON-FRI"`, `"CRON_TZ=Europe/Brussels 0 9 * * *"` |

### Cron time zones (`CRON_TZ`)

Cron schedules evaluate in **UTC by default**. To anchor a schedule to a local
time zone, prefix the expression with `CRON_TZ=<time-zone-id>` (Vixie crontab
syntax). The prefix is stored with the expression, so it survives reschedules
and daemon restarts, and it is DST-aware:

- `CRON_TZ=Europe/Brussels 0 9 * * *` — every day at 09:00 Brussels time
  (08:00 UTC in winter, 07:00 UTC during DST; transitions handled automatically).
- `CRON_TZ=America/New_York 0 9 * * MON-FRI` — weekdays at 09:00 New York time.

The time zone id must be an **IANA identifier without spaces** (e.g.
`Europe/Brussels`, `America/New_York`, `Asia/Tokyo`). Windows display names
such as `Eastern Standard Time` are not supported — the id ends at the first
space, so multi-word names resolve to a truncated, unknown identifier and the
reminder fails to schedule. When a user names a zone loosely ("Eastern time"),
translate it to the IANA id (`America/New_York`) before scheduling.

Delivery contract parameters:

- `delivery_kind`: required, one of `current_session`, `channel`, `none`
- `delivery_transport`: required when `delivery_kind=channel` (e.g. `slack`, `discord`, `mattermost`)
- `delivery_address`: required when `delivery_kind=channel` (`#channel`, `@user`, or canonical ID)
- `delivery_required`: optional bool, default `true`; set `false` only for audit/cleanup tasks
- `delivery_instructions`: optional content guidance only (never routing)
- `expires_in`: optional recurring-reminder expiry duration (for `interval`/`cron` only), e.g. `"24h"`, `"7d"`

You may also pass the structured form `delivery: { kind, transport?, address? }`
instead of the three flat delivery fields.

Rules:

- Always choose `delivery_kind` explicitly.
- Do not try to route via `delivery_instructions`.
- Use `current_session` for a reminder that must return to the current conversation.
  Slack, Discord, Mattermost, TUI, and SignalR support this route.
  Mattermost uses the original channel and thread root ID.
  Omit `delivery_transport` and `delivery_address` for this route.
  Netclaw preserves the stored reminder audience when the reminder executes.
- `channel` requires both transport + address and resolves names/handles to
  canonical IDs at set time; unresolved targets fail loud.
- Discord reminder targets must be explicit because channel IDs and user IDs are
  both snowflakes: use `channel:<channelId>` or `<#channelId>` for channel posts,
  and `dm:<userId>`, `@<userId>`, or `<@userId>` for DMs. Do not pass a bare
  Discord ID.
- `none` runs silently (history still records execution).
- `expires_in` is not valid for `once` reminders; omit it for one-shot schedules.
- For recurring reminders that are permanently complete (PR merged, deploy done,
  incident resolved), call `cancel_reminder` with that reminder's ID so it does
  not keep firing indefinitely.

`cancel_reminder` **disables** the reminder — it stops future executions but
preserves the definition file on disk for diagnosis and re-enablement.
`netclaw reminder delete <id>` permanently deletes a reminder and its history.

Reminders that hit 5 consecutive failures are auto-disabled with a
`ReminderAutoDisabled` critical alert. The definition stays on disk so the
operator can diagnose and re-enable after fixing the root cause. Both execution
failures and scheduling failures count toward the same threshold.

A **scheduling failure** is a failure to compute the next fire time. A cron with
no future occurrence, or an unresolvable `CRON_TZ` time zone, is a scheduling
failure. Netclaw raises a `ReminderScheduleFailed` alert, increments the failure
count, and never falls back to a different time — a wrong-time fire is worse than
a missed one. A scheduling failure at startup does not disable the reminder on
its own; the count must reach the threshold across restarts or fires.

A known execution or delivery failure starts the Akka.Reminders retry policy.
The retry uses bounded backoff and the same durable occurrence identity. A
successful execution resets the consecutive failure count.

A one-shot reminder stays enabled while an occurrence can retry. After a
successful acknowledgement, it becomes disabled with a `Completed` outcome. A
poison one-shot becomes disabled with a `Failed` outcome. Either way the
definition and its history stay available (`netclaw reminder history <id>`,
`netclaw reminder status <id>`). A `Completed` one-shot is pruned with its
history 12 days after it ran. Netclaw never prunes a `Failed` one-shot or any
recurring reminder, whatever its state; only `netclaw reminder delete <id>`
removes those (or removes a completed one sooner). Reminders that are disabled
or auto-disabled do not count in the `failed` figure of `netclaw stats`, which
counts only enabled reminders with failures. Creating a reminder with the id of
a completed one-shot replaces it and drops its old history; a failed one-shot
keeps its id until you delete it.

Each attempt has a 20-minute inactivity limit and a one-hour absolute limit.
The durable acknowledgement lease is 70 minutes. A daemon crash therefore lets
Akka.Reminders retry the occurrence after the lease expires.

**Failure visibility.** When a reminder execution fails for any reason — including
the 20-minute stall backstop that recovers a wedged run — the failure is posted
as a plain-language notice to the reminder's **destination channel** (for
`channel`-delivery reminders), so the operator sees it where they expect that
reminder's output. This is bounded by the auto-disable threshold (at most a few
notices plus the disabled notice), not the unbounded skip stream.

A one-shot that cannot start receives a negative acknowledgement. Akka.Reminders
then controls its retry delay. Netclaw acknowledges and skips a blocked recurring
occurrence. It does not keep a stale catch-up queue.

An interval can be shorter than the one-hour attempt limit. An interval
occurrence starts when it arrives before its next due time. If the previous run
is still active at the next due time, Netclaw skips that occurrence. After
downtime, Netclaw runs the current occurrence at most. It does not replay the
occurrences that it missed.

The status command shows the skip count:

```
netclaw reminder status <id>
```

`status` shows the enabled state, the terminal outcome, and current execution
state. It also shows the next fire, consecutive failures, skipped occurrence count,
and recent history. For one-shots, it shows the durable occurrence state, attempt
count, next retry time, and last failure reason.

Use this command when a reminder stops its expected work. A failure count that
increases usually means that the reminder or its delivery target is not healthy.

If `audience` is omitted during conversational scheduling, the reminder inherits
the audience of the channel/session that created it. A reminder cannot be
minted with broader audience than the creator currently holds; lowering the
audience is always allowed.

### Reminder visibility by audience

`list_reminders`, `get_reminder_history`, `cancel_reminder`, and the status/get
lookups scope every result to the caller's audience. A reminder is visible or
actionable only when its audience is at or below the caller's audience:

| Caller audience | Reminders it can see and act on |
|------------------|---------------------------------|
| Personal | Personal, Team, Public |
| Team | Team, Public |
| Public | Public |

A Team session cannot see a Personal reminder in `list_reminders`, cannot cancel
it, cannot read its history or status, and cannot overwrite it by reusing its ID
in `set_reminder` — each of those calls behaves exactly as it would for an ID
that does not exist. Do not treat "not found" as proof a reminder was deleted;
it may exist at a higher audience than the current session.

## Proactive channel messaging

To start a brand-new conversation on a chat channel — a `delivery_kind=channel`
reminder firing, or unprompted cross-channel outreach ("let the team know") —
use the generic proactive-post tool:

- `send_channel_message(channel_key, destination, text)` posts through the
  selected enabled channel and creates a new conversation thread when that
  channel supports it.
- `destination` must be a resolved object with `channel_key`, `kind`, and `id`.
  Do not pass bare display names like `#general` or `@alice`.
- `destination.kind="destination"` posts to a channel/destination ID returned by
  `lookup_channel_destination`.
- `destination.kind="direct_message"` sends a DM using the stable user ID from
  `lookup_channel_user`; this is supported only by channels that advertise DM
  output (Slack, Discord, and Mattermost when enabled in config).
- Reminder- and webhook-originated turns may only call `send_channel_message`
  against the delivery target configured on the reminder or webhook route. If a
  trigger turn has no configured target, Netclaw fails loud instead of choosing a
  default output channel.

Use the generic lookup tools before sending when you do not already have a
stable channel/user ID:

- `lookup_channel_user(channel_key, query)` resolves users on enabled channels
  that support user lookup, currently Slack, Discord, and Mattermost.
- `lookup_channel_destination(channel_key, query)` resolves destinations on
  enabled channels that support destination lookup. Slack can resolve channel
  names and IDs; Discord can resolve channel mentions, stable IDs, and cached
  text-channel names; Mattermost requires an exact channel ID.
- **Discovery:** call `lookup_channel_destination` with `query` omitted (or
  blank) to list every destination the channel can currently deliver to —
  Slack lists the configured allowlist (the resolved default channel plus
  `AllowedChannelIds`) with display names resolved from the API and archived
  channels excluded, Discord lists ACL-allowed guild text channels, and
  Mattermost lists the configured allowlist. Use this to answer "where can I
  post?" before sending. Listing is destination-only: user directories are
  unbounded, so `lookup_channel_user` always requires a query.

Both tools require `channel_key` as the first argument. Use the returned
`channel_key` and `stable_id` exactly; for destination lookups, use the returned
`address_kind` (`destination`) as `destination.kind`. For user lookups, set
`destination.kind` to `direct_message` and pass the returned user `stable_id`.
If lookup is ambiguous, pick from the returned candidates instead of guessing.
Do not use channel-specific lookup aliases such as `lookup_slack_user` or
`lookup_mattermost_user`; lookup is intentionally routed through the generic
channel tools.

Examples:

```
send_channel_message(
  channel_key: "slack",
  destination: { channel_key: "slack", kind: "destination", id: "C0123ABC" },
  text: "Deployment finished successfully.")

send_channel_message(
  channel_key: "mattermost",
  destination: { channel_key: "mattermost", kind: "direct_message", id: "26characterMattermostUserId" },
  text: "Your report is ready.")

send_channel_message(
  channel_key: "discord",
  destination: { channel_key: "discord", kind: "direct_message", id: "123456789012345678" },
  text: "Your report is ready.")
```

## Approval Requirements for Reminders and Webhooks

Reminders and webhooks execute without a human present — they CANNOT prompt for
tool approval. A call that needs approval and has no saved grant is denied.

### Test a reminder in a chat (`/run-reminder`)

The best way to collect the grants is to test the reminder once, attended:

- In a chat, the user types `/run-reminder <id>`. From a terminal, the user runs
  `netclaw reminder run <id>`. That command opens a normal chat with
  `/run-reminder <id>` as its first message.
- The `run-reminder` skill warns the user that the steps are real, then calls
  `run_reminder`. The tool returns the reminder's exact scheduled prompt. The
  agent carries it out in the chat. Approval prompts go to the person who
  started the test.
- An "Always here", "This repository", or "Always anywhere" answer saves a
  grant for the chat's audience. The scheduled run reads it. "Once" and
  "This chat" answers do not carry over: each scheduled run is a new session.
  The tool result shows the choice, for example `[approval: this chat only]`.
- The chat must have the same audience as the reminder. A wider chat would
  pass calls that the scheduled run denies, so `run_reminder` refuses it. A
  reminder above the chat's audience reads as not found.
- Limitation (#2330): `run_reminder` runs only in a chat at the reminder's
  audience. A CLI chat is Personal, so `netclaw reminder run` tests only
  Personal reminders. A bot with a disposition below Personal may have no chat
  where some of its reminders can be tested.
- The test does not change the schedule and writes no reminder history.

**Before creating a reminder that uses shell commands**, you can also identify
the verbs the task will need (e.g. `freshdesk`, `curl`, `git pull`) and
pre-approve them as global wildcards. Two paths:

1. **Suggest `trust-verb` from the agent.** When you (the agent) are helping the
   user set up a scheduled task, identify the verbs the task will need and ask
   the user before pre-approving each one. Example:

   > "This reminder will need to call `freshdesk --since=24h` whenever it
   > fires. Mind if I pre-approve `freshdesk` as a global verb so the reminder
   > can run unattended? I'll do this with
   > `netclaw approvals trust-verb freshdesk`."

   On confirmation, run the trust-verb command via `shell_execute`. The grant
   becomes a `(verb, null)` entry — auto-approved for any cwd.

2. **Operator runs the CLI directly:** `netclaw approvals trust-verb <verb>`.
   Same outcome; useful when the user already knows what they want.

If the user has already trusted the verb in a previous session, no action is
needed — `(verb, null)` grants persist in `tool-approvals.json` across daemon
restarts.

**Path restrictions:** A reminder or webhook uses the file-access policy of its
audience, the same as a chat of that audience (decision D2). A Personal one has
the reach of a Personal chat. A Team or Public reminder/webhook is confined to
its session directory and cannot run `shell_execute` at all, since shell is
Personal-only. A bounded (`Roots`) profile confines attended and unattended
runs alike. Protected paths — `secrets.json`, `.netclaw/keys`,
`config/webhooks` — are always denied regardless of audience or pre-approval.

**If a reminder fails with `approval_required_unattended`:** The call needs
approval, and no stored grant covers it. Test the reminder with
`/run-reminder <id>` in a chat with the same audience and answer the prompt
with an "Always" option, or run `netclaw approvals trust-verb <verb>`.

**If a reminder fails with `shell_path_outside_trusted_roots`:** The audience
profile is bounded (`Roots`) and the command targets a path outside its roots.
Either move the target into those roots, or ask the user to add the path to the
profile. A grant cannot open it.

**If a reminder fails with `shell_path_protected`:** The command uses a
protected path, such as the config directory or the keys. No grant or profile
change opens it. Use the CLI command for that setting.

## Background Jobs


A background job is a **detached process with no expectation of completion** —
use it for anything that outlives a single tool call: long builds, test suites,
dev servers, watchers. Output streams to the job's log file while it runs, and
you are notified whenever the process terminates, by whatever cause.

To submit: set `_background: true` in the `shell_execute` tool call metadata.
Approval gates are evaluated before the job starts. The submit result includes
the output log path.

Lifecycle:

- **No `_timeout_seconds` = no kill timer.** The job runs until it exits, you
  cancel it, or the session passivates. A positive `_timeout_seconds` arms an
  explicit kill timer.
- **Jobs are killed when the session passivates** (conversation idle past the
  idle timeout). A job killed this way shows as `reaped` in
  `[active-background-jobs]` on your next turn — its process is gone; resubmit
  if still needed (its output log remains readable). For work that must survive
  an idle conversation, use a scheduled task; check-back reminders also keep
  the session (and its jobs) alive across a long wait.
- On daemon restart, running jobs are killed and you receive a `lost`
  notification with the log path — relaunch if still needed.
- Process exit (success or failure) delivers a result turn with exit code,
  output tail, and log path — even if the session was passivated mid-flight.
- Netclaw retains every terminal job definition and its logs for 24 hours after
  completion. The hourly cleanup sweep then deletes both artifact types.

Monitoring a running job (e.g. waiting for a dev server to come up):

- `file_read`/`grep` the output log — it streams live (secret-redacted,
  rotation-bounded) at `~/.netclaw/jobs/{id}/output.log`.
- `check_background_job(JobId: "id")` — status, elapsed time, live output tail
- Probe the service directly (e.g. curl the port) once the log shows it started.
- `check_background_job(JobId: "id", Cancel: true)` — cancel a running job.
  **Cancel servers and watchers when you are done validating** — do not leave
  them holding one of the 5 concurrent job slots.

Rules:

- Only `shell_execute` supports background mode. Other tools ignore `_background`.
- `_timeout_seconds` alone does NOT trigger background execution.
- For synchronous calls `_timeout_seconds` is honored as you set it (no ceiling
  or floor); when omitted, the default tool timeout applies. Background jobs
  differ: omitted means no timer at all.
- Synchronous tool timeouts are wall-clock budgets for opaque tools; repeated
  stdout/progress output does not extend them. `spawn_agent` is self-monitoring:
  the parent applies NO timeout to it at all — the subagent owns its liveness end
  to end (its own prefill/no-progress watchdog reports a stall, and it always
  returns a final result). A spawned subagent is bounded only by its own internal
  watchdog or by you cancelling the turn (send another message in the thread).
- **Long-running delegation calls** (e.g. `curl` to a local coding-agent or
  model server that takes minutes to respond) should run as background jobs.
- The user must approve the command before it starts running in the background.
- Maximum 5 concurrent background jobs; overflow queues FIFO.
- Submission confirms acceptance. A queued job still needs a policy check when its slot opens.
- The job keeps its exact command, cwd, shell, and child environment while it waits.
- Use an absolute `WorkingDirectory`, or omit it to use the session or project directory.
- A revoked grant or a newly protected path can cause a failed launch. Read the job result before another request.
- A background job keeps its own lifetime after submission. Use its job identifier to cancel it.
- Job definitions persist to `~/.netclaw/jobs/{id}.json` until 24 hours after
  the job reaches a terminal state.

`check_background_job` is only available when `shell_execute` is available: the
Personal audience and a host shell mode. It validates that the requesting session matches the
submitting session's audience and boundary.

After submitting a long finite job, schedule a check-back reminder so you report
results proactively when it completes.

Active background jobs appear in the `[active-background-jobs]` section of the
session context on every turn.
