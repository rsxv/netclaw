# Tool Authorization

This document explains how Netclaw decides whether a tool call can run. It is
the canonical architecture document for people. The testable rules live in the
[`tool-authorization` OpenSpec capability](../../openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md).
This document links to those rules by ID (TA-1 to TA-16). It does not copy them.

Status: this document describes the code at `dev` revision `f7d407d6f`. Sections 2
to 5 name today's owners. A note with the label **Planned** describes a target
shape that no code has yet. The consolidation program changes one context per
PR. Each PR updates this document in the same diff.

## 1. What this covers

Tool authorization is every step between a model-authored
[tool call](../spec/GLOSSARY.md#tool-call) and the start of the tool. For a
shell call, it ends when the process starts. The result is one
[authorization](../spec/GLOSSARY.md#authorization) outcome:

| Outcome | What it means | Code value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Allowed | The tool runs. | `ToolAuthorizationOutcome.Allowed` |
| Requires consent | The call waits for an operator answer. | `ToolAuthorizationOutcome.RequiresApproval` |
| Requires correction | The model must author a different call. | `ToolAuthorizationOutcome.RequiresAgentCorrection` |
| Denied | The call does not run, and no answer can change that. | `ToolAuthorizationOutcome.Denied` |

The code values are in
[`ToolAuthorizationDecision.cs`](../../src/Netclaw.Actors/Tools/ToolAuthorizationDecision.cs).

In scope:

- first-party tools, MCP tools, `shell_execute`, and `check_background_job`;
- the main session and subagents;
- interactive channels and non-interactive runs (headless chat, reminders,
  webhooks);
- the persistent grant store and the operator CLI for it.

Not in scope:

- network exposure, device pairing, and host authentication (see
  `daemon-exposure`, `device-pairing`, `hub-auth`, and `local-control-proof`);
- validation of tool arguments against a schema (`tool-arg-validation`);
- output bounds and spill (`bounded-tool-output`);
- containment of what an allowed process does after it starts. Netclaw has no
  OS sandbox. See [section 8](#8-future-scenarios-and-their-support).

## 2. The lifecycle of one call

A call moves through named stages. Each arrow is a verb. The model follows the
approval concept map of the consolidation program.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "validated call" as Validated
    state "admitted call" as Admitted
    state "analyzed command" as Analyzed
    state "proposed candidates" as Candidates
    state "forbidden call" as Forbidden
    state "covered candidates" as Covered
    state "uncovered candidates" as Uncovered
    state "correctable call" as Correctable
    state "unanswered consent request" as Asked
    state "answered request" as Answered
    state "stored grant" as Stored
    state "authorized call" as Authorized
    state "launched process" as Launched

    [*] --> Validated: interpret
    Validated --> Admitted: admit
    Validated --> Forbidden: admit fails
    Admitted --> Analyzed: analyze (shell only)
    Admitted --> Candidates: project (other tools)
    Analyzed --> Candidates: project
    Candidates --> Forbidden: screen (hard deny, protected path, root)
    Candidates --> Covered: cover
    Candidates --> Uncovered: cover
    Uncovered --> Forbidden: no operator can answer
    Uncovered --> Correctable: advise
    Uncovered --> Asked: ask
    Asked --> Answered: answer
    Answered --> Forbidden: refuse or time out
    Answered --> Stored: record (chat, folder, repository, everywhere)
    Answered --> Authorized: once
    Stored --> Authorized: authorize again
    Covered --> Authorized: authorize
    Authorized --> Launched: re-verify and launch
    Forbidden --> [*]
    Correctable --> [*]
    Launched --> [*]
```

Notes on the diagram:

- "Screen" runs before "cover". A hard deny or a protected path ends the call
  before any grant lookup. See [TA-5](../../openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md#requirement-ta-5-hard-deny-precedes-grant-lookup-and-repeats-at-launch).
- "Correctable" ends this attempt. The model authors a new call, which starts a
  new [authorization attempt](../spec/GLOSSARY.md#authorization-attempt).
- A non-shell tool has one candidate: the tool name. `file_write` and
  `file_edit` on a control-plane path use a path-scoped candidate.
- Today, the code has no type for each stage. One decision record
  (`ToolAuthorizationDecision`) and one mutable bag (`ToolApprovalAttempt` in
  [`ToolExecutionContext.cs`](../../src/Netclaw.Tools.Abstractions/ToolExecutionContext.cs))
  carry the stages. **Planned:** one closed type per stage (consolidation PRs 5
  and 6).

## 3. The contexts

A context owns one question and the words for that question. Other code calls
its published contract. It does not repeat its checks. Six contexts and one
support module make up tool authorization.

```mermaid

    D <--> Op

```

The arrows show the order in the current shell path. A non-shell call skips
"Shell facts". Today no single class owns the order. Three classes share it:

- [`SessionToolExecutionPipeline`](../../src/Netclaw.Actors/Sessions/Pipelines/SessionToolExecutionPipeline.cs)
  runs each call, catches a consent request, and asks the operator.
- [`DispatchingToolExecutor`](../../src/Netclaw.Actors/Tools/DispatchingToolExecutor.cs)
  runs the gate inside `ExecuteStreamAsync` through `GetAuthorizedToolAsync`
  and `EvaluateAuthorizationAsync`, which asks `ToolAuthorizer` for every call.
  `GetAuthorizedToolAsync` turns a decision that is not an allow into an
  exception, which the pipeline and the subagent loop catch. This exception is
  the contract between an executor and its callers.
- [`ShellPolicyCoordinator`](../../src/Netclaw.Actors/Tools/ShellPolicyCoordinator.cs)
  supplies the shell advice and the coverage.

[`ToolAuthorizer`](../../src/Netclaw.Actors/Authorization/ToolAuthorizer.cs)
(consolidation PR 6a) states the order as one list of rules: one line per
rule, and the first rule that decides wins. It returns a closed
[`AuthorizationDecision`](../../src/Netclaw.Actors/Authorization/AuthorizationDecision.cs)
(Allowed, NeedsConsent, CorrectionRequired, or Denied) and throws no exception
for an outcome. Each rule calls the component that owns its question. A
differential test proves that it gives the same decision as the old gate. Its
shell rules, in order:

1. Admission: audience, then shell capability.
2. Prohibition: hard deny, then protected shell text.
3. Filesystem authority: a `..` in the working directory, then each slice of a
   `cd` directory proof, then each literal twin (decision F1, below).
4. Filesystem authority: the working directory and the known paths must be in
   a trusted root of the audience profile. A protected path stays denied.
5. Admission: a Deny consent mode.
6. Advice: a native tool, then Auto mode with its directory advice. Then a
   Bash source with no command is allowed: it runs no program (owner decision,
   October 2026, below). Before the advice, the authorizer asks the grant store
   for the file tool grants of the redirects that need consent.
7. A call without command text, the projected trusted-root check, the
   redirect checks of a command that runs no program, and unresolved input:
   one-time consent or a Once-only request. Since approval taxonomy
   PR 5, a Bash call splits an unresolved source into commands: each
   unresolved command is one exact candidate, and the other commands go to
   rule 8 with their own candidates. Decision D1 lets a safe phrase or a grant
   for anywhere cover an exact candidate whose only unknown part is an operand.
   A variable word (`"$d"`) is an unknown operand unless the parser resolves
   it as a path, or types its value as a filesystem value or as data. A loop
   or assignment value that names a path does not give the candidate a scope.
   Owner decision F1 (0.27.2): when the parser gives the literal twins of a
   command, the twin candidates replace the candidates of that command (see
   "Literal twins" below).
8. Consent: a covering grant (stored grant, the exemption of a side effect
   and of a command that runs no program, reviewed-safe policy), then the
   uncovered candidates.

Literal twins (owner decision F1, October 2026). ShellSyntaxTree
0.4.0-beta.23 writes each Bash command whose changeable words have a proved
finite set of values as one literal command for each combination of values
(`BashParser.TryProjectLiteralTwins`). Netclaw judges each twin as if the
operator typed it. `BashLiteralTwinSlices` (`Netclaw.Actors/Tools`) owns the
judgment. Its data is call-local.

```text
schematic: one shell call, after the parse
twins = TryProjectLiteralTwins(source)      # none under an Unknown initial state
for each command that has twins:
    for each twin:
        analysis = analyze(twin.Source, twin.WorkingDirectory)   # never run it
        require: one complete command, with the facts of twin.Occurrence
        candidates = normal candidates of the analysis
        add the assignment digest of the source command
    any twin that fails -> the command keeps its own candidates
screen each twin: hard deny, protected text, trusted root      # rule 3
replace the candidates of each twinned command with the union of its twins
cover each candidate as usual                                   # rule 8
```

- The strictest twin result wins. One denied twin denies the call. One
  uncovered twin candidate prompts, with the union of the uncovered
  candidates. The call runs with no prompt only when each twin candidate is
  covered.
- Example: `for n in 8250 8244; do gh api -X PATCH repos/o/r/issues/$n -f
  milestone=157; done` gives the twins `gh api -X PATCH repos/o/r/issues/8250
  ...` and `... 8244 ...`. A chat or folder grant for `gh api` covers them,
  and a prompt offers the normal choices.
- Negative example: `for d in ../outside/x.slnx; do dotnet build "$d"; done`
  gives the twin `dotnet build ../outside/x.slnx`. A folder grant for
  `dotnet build` does not cover the path outside the folder.
- A command without twins keeps its earlier rule. Examples: a value from
  `$(...)` (`for n in $(gh issue list); do gh api "x/$n"; done`), a program
  word from a value (`for p in /bin/rm; do $p x; done`), and any source on a
  Bash host without a proved fresh state.
- A twin keeps the shell-state assignments of its source command as an
  assignment digest, so a grant without the same assignments does not cover
  it (`x=1; for n in a b; do gh api x/$n; done`).
- `ShellProcessLaunch` screens each twin again for hard deny and protected
  text, and it rechecks the paths of each twin before the process starts.
- A call with a `cd` directory proof gets no twins: the proof already gives
  each command its exact directory.

Assignments that stay in the shell (owner decision F3, October 2026). A Bash
shell-state assignment qualifies a grant with an assignment digest, because an
exported variable can change what a program does. ShellSyntaxTree
0.4.0-beta.24 proves that an assignment reaches no program when the caller
declares the complete names of the launch environment
(`ShellLaunchEnvironment.WithCompleteEnvironmentNames`).

- `ShellExecutionEnvironment` takes one snapshot of the daemon environment
  when the daemon creates it, as it does for `HOME`.
  `CreateChildEnvironment` removes the Bash startup overrides and adds the
  launch variables. `CreateProcessStartInfo` copies that environment to each
  process, and `GetCompleteEnvironmentNames` gives its names to the parser,
  plus `PWD` and the temporary variable names that the launcher adds. The
  launcher and the parser read one snapshot, so they cannot drift. A later
  change to the daemon process environment reaches no shell process.
- The names never carry a value, and Netclaw never shows them to the model.
- `ShellAssignmentDigestFactory.ReachingProgram` skips a Bash `ShellState`
  assignment with `MayAffectProcessEnvironment == false`. A Bash data command
  (`echo`, `printf`, `test`) keeps every assignment: it reads no environment,
  and its digest keeps an operand that is not proved data
  (`d=key; echo ../x/"${d}s"/*`) out of the approval exemption.
- A read of the variable is an argument with its own value facts: an unknown
  value is an unknown operand (D1), and a known value gets its literal twin
  (F1).
- Fail closed: a Bash host without a proved fresh state, a decoded `bash -c`
  child, and PowerShell keep every assignment. `set -a`, `declare -x`, and
  `eval` make the source unresolved.

Example: `b=$(git branch --show-current); git fetch origin` with a chat grant
for `git fetch` runs with no prompt. Negative example: with `GIT_DIR` in the
daemon environment, `GIT_DIR=/tmp/x; git status` keeps its digest, so a plain
`git status` grant does not cover it.

Commands that run no program (owner decision, October 2026). Approval of `:`
means nothing, because no program runs. The only effect of such a command
outside the shell is its redirects, and the file rules own that question.

A command occurrence runs no program when the parser proves one of these
shapes (`ShellCommandAnalysis.RunsNoProgram`, `ProvesNoCommand`):

- a Bash source that parses with no command: an assignment (`x=1`), a
  comment, an empty `case` (`case x in x) ;; esac`), or an empty subshell
  (`()`);
- a command with only redirects (`> file`, `< file`), with no assignment;
- a Bash data command from the existing policy data
  (`ShellVerbPolicyData.IsDataCommand`). When a shell-state assignment reaches
  it, each operand must be proved data, as for the approval exemption (F3).

Each redirect must be a proved file redirect with one exact absolute target,
or a descriptor copy, move, or close (`2>&1`). Bash gives `/dev/tcp/...`,
`/dev/udp/...`, and `/dev/fd/N` a meaning that is not a file, so below `/dev/`
only `/dev/null` qualifies. A data command with another target is exact: its
prompt shows its full text. The rule composes general shell facts. It adds no
program grammar.

```text
schematic: the rules for a command that runs no program
source has no command (x=1)                    -> rule 6: Allowed
mark each candidate of such a command          # ShellApprovalMatcher, call-local
file tool of a redirect has mode Approval,
  and no grant of that tool covers the path    -> the candidate becomes exact:
                                                  "write <file>", "read <file>"
screen as usual: hard deny, protected text, trust zone (write rules)  # rules 2 to 4, 7
for each redirect of a marked candidate:       # rule 7
    target not proved                          -> Denied shell_redirect_unproved
    input redirect and the read rules refuse   -> Denied shell_redirect_read_denied
    file tool has mode Deny or is not admitted -> Denied shell_redirect_file_tool_denied
cover each marked candidate that is not exact  # rule 8, Coverage.Exempt
all covered -> Allowed; else prompt for the other candidates only
```

- Owners: `ShellCommandAnalysis` proves the shape. `ShellApprovalMatcher`
  marks the candidate. `ToolAccessPolicy` judges the targets
  (`ScreenNoProgramRedirects`, `WithFileToolConsent`) with
  `PathAccessPolicy` and the consent mode of the file tool. `ToolAuthorizer`
  owns the order. Each fact is call-local. Such a command never creates a
  grant.
- A redirect gets the decision of the file tool for the audience and the
  path. A write target gets the path rules of `file_write` (the shell trust
  zone) and the consent mode of `file_write`. An input target gets the trust
  zone, the path rules of `file_read`, and the consent mode of `file_read`.
  Mode `Auto` runs with no prompt. Mode `Deny` denies. With mode `Approval`,
  a stored grant of the file tool covers the redirect, as it covers the tool
  (`StoredGrantCheck` with the consent request of the tool). With no such
  grant, one prompt names each write and read that needs consent, with `Once`
  and `Deny`. That prompt cannot save a grant: answer a `file_write` prompt
  with a saved choice, or set the mode to `Auto`, to stop it. Each redirect of
  the command gets every check before the prompt, so one denied redirect
  denies the call.
- The managed temporary directory advice replaces a prompt. A command that
  runs no program has no prompt, so it gets no such advice: `: > /tmp/x` and
  `cd /tmp && : > x` both run when the rules allow the path.
- An attended and an unattended call get the same result. An unattended call
  denies each case that keeps a prompt.
- Example: `printf 'a\n' > drafts/h.tsv && : > drafts/h.json` runs with no
  prompt and no grant. `x=1; : > drafts/y` runs too.
- Negative example: `: > ~/.netclaw/config/secrets.json` is denied. A bounded
  write profile denies `printf a > ../outside/x`, and a bounded read profile
  denies `: < /etc/passwd`.
- Negative example: a program still prompts. `date > out.txt` prompts for
  `date`, and `echo $(rm -rf x) > f` prompts for `rm`.

Limits: these forms run no program but keep a prompt that shows their text,
because the parser gives no proved target or no parse for them.

- `cd dir; : > f` and `(cd dir; : > f)`: after a `cd` that can fail, the
  target has no exact value. `cd dir && : > f` runs.
- A redirect target with a loop variable (`for n in 1 2; do : > f$n; done`),
  a glob, or another unproved value.
- The operators `>|`, `>&`, and `<>`.
- Several assignments in one statement (`x=1 y=2`), an array assignment, and
  `x+=1`.
- A target behind a link. On macOS, `/var` and the default `TMPDIR` are
  behind a link. The platform temporary alias (`/tmp`) is not a limit.
- A data command with an assignment whose operand is not proved data
  (`d=key; echo ../x/"${d}s"/* > out.txt`).
- With mode `Approval`, the redirect gets no managed temporary directory
  advice, but the file tool does.

A prompt never names nothing. When a shell consent request has no candidate
and no pattern (a source that does not parse, `$cmd > x`, `eval x`,
`x=1 > f`), `ToolAuthorizer.ShowFullCommandText` makes the full command text
its one display candidate, with only `Once` and `Deny`. A request with
patterns (a PowerShell statement list) keeps them. Slack and Discord show the
command in the request line, so their header for such a request is "Approve
this command in <folder>?". The one-time key reads the
candidates and the patterns, not the display list, so a "Once" answer still
matches the retry. The 900-character rule below applies after it. The test
harness fails each test that observes a prompt with no display candidate.

Decision D2 (October 2026): an attended and an unattended call use the same
rules above. The file reach of an unattended call is the reach of its audience
profile, as in a chat. The one difference comes after rule 8: when nobody can
answer (headless chat, a reminder, a webhook, a sub-agent with no approval
bridge), the authorizer turns a consent request into the denial
`approval_required_unattended`. D2 removed the unattended-only trust zone, the
unattended unresolved-input denial, and the PR 6e rule that let a stored grant
replace a trusted-root denial for an unattended call.

After the unattended denial, an attended shell consent request whose command
text is longer than `ApprovalOptionKeys.MaxCommandTextChars` (900) becomes the
correction `shorten_shell_command`. The operator must see the full command
that they approve, and 900 characters is the command length that a Discord
prompt (2,000 characters) can show in full. The call does not run, and a
resend of the same call gets the same correction.

Each context below lists its question, the classes that answer it today, its
published contract today, what it must not know, and where its data lives.
"Leaks today" lists known places where the current code breaks the "must not
know" rule. The leaks are the work list of the consolidation program.

### 3.1 Admission

| Item | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| Question | May this audience use this tool, in this shell mode and this consent mode? |
| Classes | [`ToolAccessPolicy`](../../src/Netclaw.Actors/Tools/ToolAccessPolicy.cs) (`AdmitAudience`, `IsToolExposed`, `EvaluateShellCapability`, `GetApprovalMode`), [`ToolAudienceProfileResolver`](../../src/Netclaw.Actors/Tools/ToolAudienceProfileResolver.cs), [`ToolAudienceProfiles`](../../src/Netclaw.Configuration/ToolAudienceProfiles.cs), [`ToolApprovalConfig`](../../src/Netclaw.Configuration/ToolApprovalConfig.cs), [`TrustContextPolicy`](../../src/Netclaw.Configuration/TrustContextPolicy.cs) |
| Published contract | `ToolAccessPolicy.AdmitAudience(...)` returns a denial or null. `ToolAuthorizer` returns the `AuthorizationDecision`. `IsToolExposed(...)` filters schemas. |
| Must not know | Grants, paths, shell syntax. |
| Data | Configuration. The result is call-local. |
| Rules | [TA-1](../../openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md#requirement-ta-1-trust-context-is-explicit-and-fails-loud), [TA-2](../../openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md#requirement-ta-2-schema-exposure-grants-no-authority), [TA-3](../../openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md#requirement-ta-3-audience-profiles-admit-tools), [TA-4](../../openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md#requirement-ta-4-consent-mode-and-shell-mode-resolve-per-audience-and-tool) |

Leaks today:

- `ToolAccessPolicy` also parses shell text, runs hard deny, and builds the
  prompt options.
- Two `ToolAudienceProfileResolver` instances exist: one in `ToolAccessPolicy`
  and one in `PathAccessPolicy`. `GetApprovalMode` reads the profile defaults
  directly.
- Two functions resolve the consent mode. A code comment says that people keep
  them consistent by hand.
- The effective shell mode is `Tools.ShellMode ?? Security.ShellExecutionMode ??`
  the posture default. Two keys carry one setting.

### 3.2 Shell facts

| Item | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| Question | What does this command do, in general shell terms? |
| Classes | ShellSyntaxTree through [`ShellCommandAnalysis`](../../src/Netclaw.Security/ShellCommandAnalysis.cs); candidate extraction in `ShellApprovalMatcher` ([`IToolApprovalMatcher.cs`](../../src/Netclaw.Security/IToolApprovalMatcher.cs)); [`ShellTokenizer`](../../src/Netclaw.Security/ShellTokenizer.cs) and [`ShellApprovalSemantics`](../../src/Netclaw.Security/ShellApprovalSemantics.cs) (legacy parser); [`BashDirectoryScopeProjection`](../../src/Netclaw.Actors/Tools/BashDirectoryScopeProjection.cs) (the directory of each occurrence after a Bash `cd`); [`BashLiteralTwinSlices`](../../src/Netclaw.Actors/Tools/BashLiteralTwinSlices.cs) (the literal twins of a Bash command, F1); [`ShellPolicyPathFacts`](../../src/Netclaw.Actors/Tools/ShellPolicyPathFacts.cs); [`ShellFileSystemTreeAccessPolicy`](../../src/Netclaw.Security/ShellFileSystemTreeAccessPolicy.cs) |
| Published contract | `ShellCommandPolicy.Analyze(...)` returns a `ShellCommandAnalysis`. `ShellApprovalMatcher.AnalyzeInvocation(...)` returns candidates and an "unresolved" flag (`IsMessy` in code). |
| Must not know | Grants, audience, the private grammar of an executable. |
| Data | Call-local. |
| Rules | [TA-7](../../openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md#requirement-ta-7-shell-analysis-uses-general-syntax-facts) |

Fixed text on stdin (owner decision 2026-10-07, heredoc parity):

- A heredoc with a quoted delimiter and a here string with a proved value
  give fixed text on stdin. Netclaw treats the text as it treats text from a
  pipe: it reads no path and no command from it.
- The command keeps its normal candidate. A grant for `python3` covers
  `python3 - <<'EOF'` as it covers `python3 -c '...'`. Each interpreter rule
  of the argument form also applies to the stdin form.
- These forms stay unresolved (one exact candidate, "Once" only):
  - an unquoted delimiter (ShellSyntaxTree marks it `Expand`);
  - a here string with an unknown value;
  - a descriptor other than stdin;
  - a command with Unknown command words, for example `python3 - "$f"` in a
    loop, because a literal twin cannot carry a heredoc;
  - a shell receiver. The file name of each verb word decides: `bash`,
    `./bash`, `/usr/local/bin/bash`, `bash.exe`, `env sh`, `xargs bash`,
    `pwsh`, `cmd`. An argument counts too when a part of its proved value
    between white space is a shell file name (`timeout 5 /opt/x/bash`,
    `env -S 'bash -s'`, `ssh host 'bash -s'`), or when it has no proved value
    (`env "$tool"`, a glob).
- Netclaw analyzes the script of `bash -c` as child commands. It does not
  analyze the text of a heredoc or a here string as a script. Thus a grant for
  a shell does not cover such text. Text from a pipe (`printf ... | bash`) is
  outside this rule.
- Fixed text on stdin opens no file. A data command with such text
  (`: <<'EOF'`, `echo x <<< 'y'`) still runs no program and needs no prompt,
  and the file rules judge each file redirect of the command. A program with
  such text and a write redirect (`python3 - > out.txt <<'EOF'`) keeps its
  normal candidate and the write scope.
- Known limits:
  - A program that reads paths from stdin gets its normal candidate. A folder
    grant for `xargs cat` covers `xargs cat <<< /etc/passwd`, as it covers
    `printf /etc/passwd | xargs cat`.
  - Netclaw does not read the private grammar of a program. It tests each
    part of an argument value, so a shell name in a data argument makes the
    call exact (`grep bash <<'EOF'`, `grep 'run bash now' <<'EOF'`). This is
    the safe direction (owner decision 2026-10-08).
  - The shell names are a list, and a list cannot be complete. A shell that
    is not in the list (`elvish`, `nu`, `xonsh`) gets the result of its `-c`
    form. A program that gives stdin text to `sh` (`at now`, `batch`,
    `crontab -`, `parallel`) gets the result of its pipe form.
  - ShellSyntaxTree 0.4.0-beta.24 does not parse source after the heredoc
    operator on its line (`cat <<'EOF' > out.txt`, `python3 - <<'EOF' | head`).
    Such a call keeps the "Once" prompt. A redirect before the operator
    (`cat > out.txt <<'EOF'`) gets the normal candidate.
- Owner: `ShellCommandAnalysis.HasFixedTextStdin`. The shell names are policy
  data in `ShellVerbPolicyData.ScriptShellNames`. The data is call-local.

Leaks today:

- Two parsers read one command: ShellSyntaxTree and the legacy tokenizer.
  Hard deny and the protected-path check use both.
- Three projections produce candidates for one compound Bash command: the
  matcher candidates of the full parse, the directory proof for a list with
  an exact `cd`, and the literal twins of a command with proved finite values
  (`BashLiteralTwinSlices`). The directory proof also marks the diagnostics of a
  causal list (`cd dir && action; diagnostic`) for the reviewed-safe intent
  rule. That rule and the headless denial of a causal list stay until the
  owner changes the outcomes that they protect. The side-effect exemption
  (`echo`, `printf`, `:`, `true`, `false`) applies in a causal list too: the
  exempt command has no directory, so the list role does not change it. The
  exemption of a command that runs no program does not read the role either.
  After a directory change that can fail, the directory of a later command is
  not known, and an unresolved call makes that command exact. A data command
  with no redirect and proved data operands is the exception (0.27.1): it has
  no path scope, so it keeps its normal candidate and its exemption.
- `ResolveAuthorizationScope` in `IToolApprovalMatcher.cs` names `find`, `cd`,
  `pushd`, and `Set-Location`. This conflicts with the Shell Approval
  Abstraction Rule in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md).

### 3.3 Filesystem authority

| Item | Current state |

| Question | Which exact path is this? Is it inside a boundary that the caller holds? Is it protected for this operation? |
| Classes | [`PathAccessPolicy`](../../src/Netclaw.Actors/Tools/PathAccessPolicy.cs) (`Evaluate`, `EvaluateShellPath`, `EvaluateReviewedShellPath`, `EvaluateGeneratedDestination`), [`ToolPathPolicy`](../../src/Netclaw.Security/ToolPathPolicy.cs) (protected lists), [`PathUtility`](../../src/Netclaw.Security/PathUtility.cs), [`ShellPathRules`](../../src/Netclaw.Security/ShellPathRules.cs), [`GitRepositoryApprovalScope`](../../src/Netclaw.Security/GitRepositoryApprovalScope.cs), [`DaemonToolPathPolicyFactory`](../../src/Netclaw.Daemon/Configuration/DaemonToolPathPolicyFactory.cs) |
| Published contract | `PathAccessPolicy.Evaluate(raw, context, FileOperation)` returns a [path access decision](../spec/GLOSSARY.md#path-access-decision): `Allowed(CanonicalPath)` or `Denied(...)`. |
| Must not know | Audience rules outside the root catalog, grants, shell syntax. |
| Data | Call-local. Git repository facts are read from disk at each check. The protected path sets are process-local. |
| Rules | [TA-6](../../openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md#requirement-ta-6-path-access-decisions-own-file-tool-authority) |

Leaks today:

- More than 11 places check for a link, 3 functions normalize Windows paths,
  and 5 functions test containment with 3 different case rules.
- A platform temporary-path predicate from the Advice module also relaxes a
  link check for causal intent (`ShellPolicyCoordinator.cs`,
  `ToolAccessPolicy.cs`).
- `skill_manage` has its own mutation guard
  (`SkillManageTool.GuardMutationTarget`, #2247). The guard reuses
  `PathUtility.ContainsSymlinkSegment` and the shared `ToolPathPolicy`
  write-deny list, but it is one more place that composes the link and
  protection checks.

**Planned:** a closed `PathBoundary` union with three operations
(canonicalize, evaluate, resolve repository). See consolidation PR 3.

### 3.4 Prohibition

| Item | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| Question | Is this command or path forbidden, whatever consent exists? |
| Classes | [`ShellCommandPolicy`](../../src/Netclaw.Security/ShellCommandPolicy.cs) and its deny patterns, [`HardDenyRule`](../../src/Netclaw.Security/HardDenyRule.cs), [`HardDenyOverridesLoader`](../../src/Netclaw.Security/HardDenyOverridesLoader.cs), `ToolPathPolicy.CommandReferencesDeniedPath` |
| Published contract | `ShellCommandPolicy.Evaluate(analysis)` returns a `ShellCommandDecision`. `ToolPathPolicy.CommandReferencesDeniedPath(...)` returns a bool. |
| Must not know | Grants, prompts. |
| Data | Configuration (`Tools.HardDenyPatterns` and `config/hard-deny-overrides.json`). The rules are process-local. |
| Rules | [TA-5](../../openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md#requirement-ta-5-hard-deny-precedes-grant-lookup-and-repeats-at-launch), [TA-6](../../openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md#requirement-ta-6-path-access-decisions-own-file-tool-authority) |

Leaks today:

- An approved shell call runs the hard-deny list at least 4 times: in the gate,
  in the gate again inside the launch callback, and twice in
  `ShellProcessLaunch.CheckHardPolicies`.
- Some deny patterns name executables (`kill`, `rm -rf /`). This is policy
  data, which the Shell Approval Abstraction Rule permits. Since owner
  decision D2 (approval taxonomy PR 6), a kill is denied only when its operand
  text names the Netclaw daemon. It must not grow
  into a parser for an executable.
- Since ShellSyntaxTree 0.4.0-beta.17, the parser proves the value of a word
  that reads a binding (`x=/; rm -rf "$x"`). The hard-deny list also checks
  each proved value, and each value of a loop variable, so the bound form gets
  the decision of its literal twin. More than 256 value combinations deny.
- Since ShellSyntaxTree 0.4.0-beta.18, a bounded `$((...))` is data: never a
  path and never a command word. Arithmetic that reads a command substitution
  or a variable without a proved integer value, and an arithmetic command
  `((...))`, stay unresolved, because Bash evaluates those values as code. A
  brace word (`{a,b}`) has an unknown value and no path, and a brace word in
  the program word is unresolved. A bounded `break`, `continue`, `exit`, or
  `return` in a loop no longer makes the source unresolved; all four are data
  commands.
- Since ShellSyntaxTree 0.4.0-beta.19, an ANSI-C word (`$'\x6beys'`) has its
  decoded value, and each proved path value also gets the default credential
  store text hints. For a program that can open files, a word that Bash can
  glob (`MayPathnameExpand`) with an unknown value is not covered by decision
  D1: the command is one exact candidate with `Once` and `Deny` only. When
  this rule is the only cause and a rewrite of the words can remove the word,
  the call gets the rewrite correction instead; the candidate stays exact.
  When the command words are known, that correction is the quote correction
  (`ShellWordQuoteSuggested`, 0.27.1): it names each such word
  (`ShellCommandAnalysis.GetUnboundedPathnameExpansionWords`). In double
  quotes, the word gets no pathname expansion, so the retry has one unknown
  operand, and decision D1 applies. The
  rule does not read `MayFieldSplit`: a word that can split but cannot glob
  (`"$@"`, a bounded arithmetic word) keeps the check of a normal operand. A proved
  glob scope keeps decision D5, and a proved authored value with no glob
  character is exempt. Owner decision (#2349): `echo` and `printf` operands
  stay data (the worst case is file names in the output), and `test` and `[`
  keep the proved-value rule.
- Since ShellSyntaxTree 0.4.0-beta.22, the parser shows three Bash forms that
  it hid before. Netclaw needs no change for them: each hidden command is now a
  candidate, or the source is unresolved.
  - A line continuation inside an expansion (`echo "$\<LF>(touch x)"`) shows
    `touch`.
  - A `#` right after a quote is word text (`echo "a"# ; touch x`), so the
    parser shows `touch`.
  - A carriage return outside quotes, comments, and heredoc bodies makes the
    source unresolved, as does a backslash before a CR in double quotes.
  - A reserved word across a continuation is unresolved. An inline
    `--name=value` value comes from the decoded word, else it is `Unknown`. A
    `~` after `=` or `:` in an argument expands only in a proved non-POSIX
    Bash with a launch-proved `HOME`, else it is `Unknown`.
- Since ShellSyntaxTree 0.4.0-beta.24, an option word with a quoted or an
  escaped `=` has the facts of the unquoted word. Netclaw needs no change.
  - `tar --file'='../x` and `awk -F'[= ]' '{print $2}' f` were unparseable,
    so they got only `Once` and `Deny`. They are now normal candidates.
  - A fully quoted option word (`tar "--file=../x"`) had no path fact for its
    value, so a folder `tar` grant covered a path outside the folder. The
    value now has the path fact of `--file=../x`, and the call prompts.
  - A `~` after a quoted `=` is text, as in Bash.
  - An option word with an expansion and no proved value (`-o"$n"`,
    `--$n=x`, `--$(cmd)=x`) has an `Unknown` value, so it is an unknown
    operand (decision D1).
- Owner decision D5 (option A): a glob word gets the decision of each literal
  protected path that its segments can match, or of a directory that contains
  one (`ToolPathPolicy.GlobMayReachDeniedPath`). The match is lexical: Netclaw
  does not list directories or follow links for this check. A link below the
  covering directory that leads to a protected path is an accepted gap.

  `ParentApprovalDecision`, option keys, `ApprovalGrantScope`, the nullable
  `Directory` and `Repository` fields of `ApprovalEntry`, `ShellCoverageKind`,
  and display strings.
- 9 places decide which output commands (`echo`, `printf`, `:`, `true`,
  `false`) need no consent.
- Grant match for one shell candidate can run up to 5 times in one gate run.

Leak today: `IsEligiblePlatformTemporaryPath` is also an authority input for
causal intent. **Planned:** move that rule into Filesystem authority as a named
link rule for the macOS `/tmp` alias.

### 3.8 Launch re-verification

[`ShellProcessLaunch`](../../src/Netclaw.Actors/Tools/ShellProcessLaunch.cs)
is the last step before a process starts. It checks hard deny and protected
paths, captures the known path targets, runs the full gate again through a
callback, checks hard deny again, and stops if a path target changed. See
[TA-14](../../openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md#requirement-ta-14-launch-re-verifies-the-authorized-call).
#2122 added this shared check at process start to close a time-of-check to
time-of-use gap.

## 4. One call, end to end

This sequence shows a shell call that needs consent. The upper branch shows a
live answer. The lower branch shows an answer after the daemon restarts or the
session passivates.

Facts behind the diagram (current code):

- The pipeline catches the consent request in
  `SessionToolExecutionPipeline.cs` and returns the headless text when no
  operator can answer. Evals assert this exact text.
- The session actor journals the request before it sends the prompt
  (`HandleToolInteractionRequestDispatch` in `LlmSessionActor.cs`).
- An unanswered request does not keep the session in memory. An answer
  rehydrates the session and re-drives the parked batch
  (`HandleToolInteractionResponseWhenIdle`, `RedriveToolBatchForApproval`).
- No timer denies an unanswered request. The session and its subagents ask
  through one prompt, `ParentSessionApprovalBridge`, which waits with the
  session's approval timeout. The daemon sets that timeout to infinite. The
  request waits until the operator answers, the run is cancelled, or a new user
  message abandons the parked batch.
- A subagent request goes to the parent through `ParentSessionApprovalBridge`.
  It is live-only. After a restart, Netclaw rejects the old prompt as expired.
  A subagent without a parent bridge cannot ask. Its whole run fails with
  `ToolExecutionFailed`; it does not return a per-tool denial.
- A channel that cannot post a prompt sends `Deny` for that call
  (`ChannelOutputEngine`, `SlackThreadBindingActor`). This is the only
  automatic denial of a consent request.

A non-shell call follows the same path, with two differences. `ToolAuthorizer`
applies the rules for other tools and one `StoredGrantCheck` in place of the
shell coverage. The launch step does not exist.

## 5. Language

Each context uses its own words. The
[engineering glossary](../spec/GLOSSARY.md#authorization-language) defines the
shared words. This section shows which context uses each word and how the words
translate at each seam. It does not repeat the definitions.

| Context | Its words | Code names today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admission | audience, tool, consent mode, shell mode, admission | `TrustAudience`, `ToolAudienceProfile`, `ToolApprovalMode` (`Auto`, `Approval`, `Deny`), `ShellExecutionMode` |
| Shell facts | command occurrence, phrase, effective directory, unresolved syntax | `CommandOccurrence`, `ApprovalCandidate.Verb`/`VerbTokens`, `IsMessy` |
| Filesystem authority | canonical path, trusted root, boundary, file operation, protected path | `CanonicalPath`, `PathAccessDecision`, `FileOperation`, `ToolPathPolicy` lists |
| Prohibition | deny rule, hard deny | `DenyPattern`, `HardDenyRule`, `DenyCategory` |
| Consent | candidate, coverage, grant, grant scope, one-time consent | `ApprovalCandidate`, `ShellCoverageKind`, `ApprovalEntry`, `ApprovalGrantScope`, `OneTimeApprovalKeys` |
| Consent delivery | consent request, option, consent answer, requester | `ToolInteractionRequest`, `ToolApprovalOption`, `ApprovalDecision`, `ApprovalButtonValueCodec` |

Translation at each seam:

| Seam | From | To |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shell facts → Consent | a command occurrence with its effective directory | one candidate (`ApprovalCandidate(Verb, Directory)`) |
| Consent → Filesystem authority | a folder grant scope | a folder boundary with the "links below the root" rule (`ApprovalPatternMatching.EvaluateApprovalScope`) |
| Consent → Filesystem authority | a repository grant scope | a Git common directory, proved again at each check (`GitRepositoryApprovalScope`) |
| Consent delivery → Consent | an option key (`approve_always`) | an answer (`ApprovalDecision.ApprovedAlways`), then a grant scope (`ApprovalGrantScope.Folder`) |
| Consent → Consent delivery | uncovered candidates | a consent request with options and display text |

Words to avoid in new prose, with the replacement:

- "trust zone": use "trusted root". The token stays only in the reason code
  `shell_working_directory_outside_trust_zone`.
- "messy": use "unresolved syntax". `IsMessy` stays as a code name.
- "policy" for an evaluator class: name the context. Use "policy data" for
  configuration.
- "decision" for the operator's reply: use "consent answer". "Decision" means
  the authorization outcome.

## 6. Architecture guidelines

Each guideline has one example that follows it and one example that breaks it.
A reviewer uses these guidelines to judge a change.

### 6.1 One owner per decision

Each decision has one owner. Other code calls that owner.

- Follows: `file_read` asks `PathAccessPolicy.Evaluate` for its path decision.
  It does not write its own containment check.
- Breaks: `SkillReadResourceTool` has its own link walker
  (`ContainsSymlink`), which repeats the Filesystem authority link rule with a
  different case rule.

### 6.2 A new check goes in the context that owns its question

Find the question first. Then put the check in the context that answers that
question.

- Follows: the rule "a Public audience cannot use `file_edit`" is an admission
  question. It lives in the audience profile data and `ToolAccessPolicy`.
- Breaks: the macOS `/tmp` alias rule is a filesystem question. Today it lives
  in the temporary-path advice code and relaxes an authority check.

### 6.3 Closed unions for stages and scopes

A stage or a scope is a closed set of cases. The compiler must find every
switch that needs a new case.

- Follows: `ApprovalGrantScope` is an abstract record with the cases Session,
  Folder, and Repository.
- Breaks: `ApprovalEntry` encodes six entry shapes through nullable fields. A
  null `Directory` means "everywhere". The compiler cannot check a switch over
  that.

### 6.4 No private executable grammar

Shell analysis uses general shell facts: syntax, control flow, typed values,
path scopes, and authority boundaries. It does not parse the options or
subcommands of one executable. A safe-verb list or a deny list is policy data.
See the Shell Approval Abstraction Rule in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) and
[TA-7](../../openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md#requirement-ta-7-shell-analysis-uses-general-syntax-facts).

- Follows: `git status` becomes a phrase from ShellSyntaxTree tokens. The
  reviewed-safe catalog lists that phrase as data.
- Follows: a shell grant matches the ShellSyntaxTree `CommandWords` fact
  (0.4.0-beta.8 position rule). The words are the program, the verb slot (the
  first word after the program and its options), and the plain words after it.
  `ToolApprovalEntryComparer.CoversCommandWords` is the one rule for the
  approval matcher and the store hygiene (owner decision, 2026-10-05). A grant
  of two or more words names a verb and covers the words that start with its
  words: a `git push` grant covers `git push origin main`, and a
  `dotnet package search` grant covers each package. A grant of one word names
  only the program and covers that word alone: a `gh` grant covers
  `gh --help` but not `gh auth logout`. A grant word is never free, so a
  `git push origin feature-x` grant does not cover `git push origin main`.
  `gh -R o/r pr view 1` and `gh pr view 1 -R o/r` both match a `gh pr view`
  grant. Options, option values, paths,
  path patterns with `/`, words with a digit, quoted text with whitespace, and
  (after the verb slot) expansions and globs are arguments. So
  `dotnet build -c Release` gives `dotnet build`, and
  `gh pr update-branch $n` gives `gh pr update-branch`. Known limit: a plain
  word after a flag that takes no value is also skipped (`git push -f origin
  main` gives `git push main`). A word after the verb slot that names an
  existing file or directory (not a link) in the occurrence directory is a
  path operand, not a command word: with `Phobos.slnx` on disk,
  `dotnet build Phobos.slnx` gives `dotnet build`, and the file gets a path
  scope for the trusted-root and protected-path checks. A word that names a
  link stays a command word. `ToolPathPolicy` checks the target of each plain
  word after the program word that names a link, command word or argument, and
  denies a protected target. The link and its final target are both scopes
  of the candidate (see the link target item below).
  The program word and
  the verb slot never drop, so a file named `push` does not change `git push`.
  ShellSyntaxTree is lexical, so `ShellApprovalMatcher.ProjectCommandWords`
  reads the disk once per word. An unknown occurrence directory drops no word,
  and an exact candidate keeps its words. The stored match kind keeps the name
  `TokenPrefix`, so the version-3 store does not change. A legacy phrase uses
  the same rule for its words.
  Policy data gives some programs a one-token chain (`echo`, `which`, `jq`); a
  bare-program grant for them also covers their plain words.
- Follows: a candidate has one grant identity. `ShellApprovalMatcher` owns it,
  and the data is call-local. The candidate verb is the phrase text of the
  command words, after the program path rule (R1) below. The prompt shows that
  verb, the answer saves those words, and a grant matches those words.
  `GrantIdentityApprovalTests` proves two facts. For each candidate of each
  catalog command, the saved entry has the text of the candidate verb (chat,
  folder, and everywhere scope). For the `pipedrive` command below, the saved
  grant covers the next call through the approval actor.

  The pseudocode is schematic. It omits hard deny, protected paths, the
  reviewed-safe policy, and the link checks of a scope.

  ```text
  words    = CommandWords(occurrence) minus file words, with the program path
  verb     = phrase(words)              # prompt, CandidateVerbs, "Saved" line
  grant    = TokenPrefix(shell, words, digest, scope)   # the answer saves it
  covered  = grant.shell == shell
             and grant.digest == digest                 # assignment digest
             and wordsCovered(grant.words, words)
             and scopeCovers(grant.scope, directory)    # folder or repository
  wordsCovered(g, w) =
             g is a prefix of w and (g.Count >= 2 or w.Count == 1)
             or g.Count == 1 and g[0] == w[0]
                and policy data gives g[0] a one-token chain (grep, echo, jq)
  word equality: with case for Bash, without case for PowerShell
  ```

  Positive example: `pipedrive dealFields list --custom-only --json` shows
  `pipedrive dealFields list`. The answer "This chat" saves those words, and
  the grant covers `pipedrive dealFields list --json`. Negative example: that
  grant does not cover `pipedrive organizationFields list` or
  `pipedrive deals delete 42`, and a program-only grant `pipedrive` covers
  neither. In Bash it also does not cover `pipedrive dealfields list`. In
  PowerShell it does, because PowerShell words compare without case. The
  prompt removes equal verbs with the same case rule, so a Bash call with
  both spellings shows two verbs. Before this rule, the verb came from the
  ShellSyntaxTree verb walk (`Clause.Verb`). That walk stops at a word with an
  uppercase letter, so the prompt showed `pipedrive` for a grant of three
  words. The saved grant was already correct. The verb walk now serves policy
  only: the data-command rule, the one-token chain data, the directory operand
  verbs, reviewed-safe phrases, and hard deny. The approval exemption of a
  data command reads the first command word
  (`ApprovalPatternMatching.PolicyProgram`), not the verb text. Two candidates
  keep another verb, because they save no grant from it: a command with
  `Unknown` words keeps its policy verb, and an exact candidate keeps its
  source text. The match label of a decision (`ToolApprovalMatch.Pattern`)
  shows the verb of the covered candidate, not the words of the grant.
- Follows: a word that names a link has two path scopes (#2375). This is a
  general path fact, not a rule for one program.
  - The scopes are the folder that holds the link and the final target of the
    link chain. `ShellApprovalMatcher.TryAddLinkScopes` adds the two scopes.
  - Each spelling of one link gets the same two scopes: a path word
    (`cat ext.txt`, `mytool read ./extlink`, `node_modules/.bin/tsc`), a
    plain word that names a link in the occurrence directory
    (`mytool read extlink`, `gh api --input ext.txt x`), and an option value
    (`mytool read --input=ext.txt`). An option value that names a link does
    not stay in the working directory, so it is a path word
    (`TryAddPathWordScopes`).
    `ToolPathPolicy.FindLinkWords` is the one loop that finds the plain words,
    for the protected-path screen and for the scopes.
  - `FileSystemAuthority.FollowLinkChain` is the one reader of a final link
    target for grant scopes and glob words. It reads the chain from the disk
    at authorization time. A relative link text resolves against the lexical
    directory of its link, so an alias above a grant root stays in the target.
  - The protected-path screen (`FileSystemAuthority.IsProtected`) keeps the
    host resolver, because its failures deny (R13), and that includes the
    Windows drive root. The host resolver removes a `..` in a link text
    lexically. So for a link that `FollowLinkChain` cannot name, the screen
    also resolves the path as the OS does (`TryResolvePhysicalPath`) and
    denies a protected result. Positive example: `keydd.txt` with the text
    `ncdir/../keys/a.pem`, where `ncdir` is a link to the Netclaw `logs`
    folder, is denied. Negative example: `dotdot.txt` with the same shape and
    an ordinary target is not denied; it gets exact consent only.
  - Each candidate scope needs coverage (TA-8). So a folder or repository
    grant covers the word only when it covers the link folder and the target.
    The link walk of the folder grant also checks the target scope, so a
    directory link in the target path is refused.
  - A grant without a folder and a chat grant cover the word, because they
    also cover the target path.
  - A dangling link gets the decision of the target path that its link text
    states, because a write through the link creates the file there. A target
    in the scope is covered. A target outside the scope is not covered.
  - A link without a known target fails closed. A `..` in a link text that
    leaves a link, or a rooted link text that is not a full path, makes the
    occurrence unresolved. It gets exact consent only, also with a grant for
    anywhere, unless the protected-path screen denies it first. The screen
    cannot resolve a loop or a chain of more than 40 links, so it denies
    those (R13).
  - A glob word uses the same reader and is stricter. Each link entry of a
    walked directory must have an existing final target in that same
    directory (`HasOnlyContainedLinkEntries`). If not, the word is unresolved
    and gets exact consent only. So a link to a sibling folder in the grant, a
    link out of the folder, and a dangling entry each keep a literal word
    covered or give it a folder prompt, but leave a glob word unresolved.
  - A platform temporary alias, such as macOS `/tmp`, is an OS alias (R7).
    The word `/tmp` keeps its one lexical scope.
  - A word that is not a full host path of the shell's style names no host
    link. It keeps its lexical scope.
  - A data command (`echo`) gets no path scope, so the rule does not apply to it.
  - Known limits. The rule does not reach these forms:
    - A link that the same command creates or changes before the program runs
      (`ln -s ../x y && cat y`). This is a run-time effect.
    - A directory link in the middle of a path word (`current/app.js`,
      `cd innerdir && ...`). The link rule below the grant root refuses it,
      also when its target is in the folder.
    - A value that the parser does not split from its word: a short option
      with an attached value (`-iextlink`), a `key=value` word without a dash
      (`if=ext.txt`), and text before the path (`@ext.txt`). Such a word has no
      path scope today, also for a literal path outside the folder
      (https://github.com/netclaw-dev/netclaw/issues/2383). A fix for that
      issue must send each path that it adds through `TryAddPathWordScopes`,
      which adds the link scopes.
    - A redirect to a link (`> inner.txt`). It gets exact consent only, also
      when the target is in the folder.
    - A link as the program word (`./tool` that points to `/usr/bin/rm`). The
      target of a program word is not a scope.
    - A hard link. No path check can see it.
    - A Windows junction or volume mount point. No test covers them, and the
      grant tests with real links run on POSIX hosts only. The chain ends at a
      reparse point that has no link text.
    - A link text with a trailing separator before a second link
      (`tsl -> innerdir/`). The chain stops there, so the word prompts also
      when the target is in the folder.
    - A link with an unknown target and an ordinary real target. The operator
      sees only the word in the exact prompt, not the path that the OS opens.
    - A change of the target between the decision and the launch. The launch
      check does not read the target of a plain link word again.
- Follows: a program path names a file, not a spelling (R1). When the
  program word has a slash, `ShellApprovalMatcher` replaces it with the
  lexical absolute path: it joins a relative path with the occurrence working
  directory (after each `cd`) and collapses `.` and `..`. The shared rule is
  `ShellProgramPath` in `Netclaw.Configuration`. So `cd /opt/bin && ./tool`
  and `/opt/bin/tool` give one grant, and `cd /tmp && ./tool` is another file.
  A bare name keeps its `PATH` meaning. The rule is lexical, because the
  existing `..`-after-link guard already makes such an occurrence unresolved.
  When the working directory is not known, the word keeps its spelling. A
  repository grant stores the path below the worktree root (`./scripts/x.sh`).
  The store reads older `~/x`, `/abs/x`, and folder `./x` grants as absolute
  paths at load time. A `./x` grant with no folder covers the files that the
  spelling can reach and is shown as a legacy program spelling. A `~/x`
  program has `Unknown` words in ShellSyntaxTree 0.4.0-beta.10, so it gets the
  `WriteProgramPathInFull` correction.
- Follows: a command word is its static value after quote removal. A program
  word can contain a space: `"my tool"`, `'my tool'`, and `my\ tool` are one
  word, and `"/opt/My App/bin/tool"` is that path (R1). The grant stores the
  word list. `ShellCommandWordText` in `Netclaw.Configuration` quotes a word
  with whitespace in the phrase text, so the prompt shows `'my tool'`. The
  phrase text is also a policy input: the program `"echo x"` has the phrase
  `'echo x'`, so it is not the approval-exempt verb `echo`. Unquoted, `my tool`
  is the program `my` and its word `tool`, which is another grant.
- Follows: `Unknown` command words mean that no grant can cover the call.
  They occur only when the verb slot holds a bare glob (`*`, `p?sh`), an
  expansion, a brace list, or word splitting (`git {push,fetch}`,
  `rm -f {a,b}.txt`). Reviewed-safe policy and the approval-exempt output commands still
  apply first. An uncovered candidate with `Unknown` words gets a rewrite
  correction (`ShellCommandWordsRewriteSuggested`, "Tool execution deferred:
  rewrite_shell_command_words"): the call does not run and does not prompt,
  and the rewritten call passes normal approval. A bare glob is correctable in
  both shells; the other causes are correctable in Bash only. A dynamic program
  name or a PowerShell script block keeps the one-time prompt (an unattended
  run denies it).
- Follows (owner, 2026-10-07): Netclaw sends a correction only when a rewrite
  that the model can make removes the cause. The source holds the literal
  words when the parser proves each authored value (`for v in push fetch`), or
  when the word has no `$` and no backtick (a brace list `{push,fetch}`, a
  glob). A word with a run-time value has no literal spelling: an environment
  value (`[ -n "$FOO" ]`, `git "$FOO" origin`), a `$(...)` result
  (`git $(cmd) origin`), `$?`, or a file name from a glob loop
  (`for f in src/*; do [ -f "$f" ]; done`). Such a command gets a one-time
  prompt with `Once` and `Deny`. No grant covers it, and an unattended run
  denies it. The first word that Bash can change decides: in
  `git {push,fetch} origin "$BRANCH"` the brace list is the cause, so the
  correction stays, and in `git "$FOO" *.md` the run-time word is the cause,
  so the call prompts.
  `ShellApprovalMatcher.ClassifyUnknownCommandWords` owns this call-local
  check. ShellSyntaxTree gives no typed fact for an expansion in a word, so
  the check reads `$` and the backtick in the raw word. That is shell syntax,
  not the grammar of a program. Each command-words and quote correction has a
  test row that applies the rewrite and gets no correction on the retry
  (`SubcommandEverywhereGrantTests.CorrectionRewrites`).
- Follows: a test builtin with a run-time operand stays a prompt, not
  approval-exempt data as `echo "$FOO"` is. Both rules ask one question: can
  an operand value run code or reach a path? An `echo` operand only prints.
  A `test` or `[` operand can be a `-v` name whose subscript runs a command,
  and Netclaw does not parse the test operators to see which operand is the
  operator.
- Breaks: "a test builtin with a run-time operand is data". On Bash 5.2,
  `x='a[$(cmd)]'; [ -v "$x" ]` runs `cmd`. Do not simplify the rule that way.
- Breaks: `[ -n "$FOO" ]` gets `WriteWordsLiterally`. The model cannot write
  the value of `FOO`, so it repeats the call or stops.
- Follows: an option value can name a path (#2364, 0.27.2). The rule uses a
  parser fact, not the `--name=value` shape: ShellSyntaxTree 0.4.0-beta.24
  gives some elements two arguments, an option and a value. Examples are
  `--output=../x`, `--output\=../x`, `--output'='../x`, `"--output=../x"`, and
  `-p:OutDir=../x`. The parser types the value as a path only from its own
  option tables. Netclaw has no option tables, so `ShellApprovalMatcher`
  (`ResolveOptionValuePathWords`) reads each proved value as a possible
  location. A value that can leave the working directory becomes a path word
  with the same text, and the path word code gives its scope. Its data is
  call-local.

  ```text
  schematic: one value argument of one occurrence
  parser types the value as a path -> the path word rule already applies
  value unproved (Bash)            -> no scope here; unknown operand (D1)
  text = value after the option; for a glob, the text before the first
         glob character ("~" is a name: Bash expands no "~" after "=")
  glob with ".." or with "$" before the glob character -> the path word
         rule decides (the command is exact)
  text is not a path of the path style (URL, date) -> no scope
  location below the working directory, no link    -> no scope
  otherwise -> a path word with this text: file-parent rule, absent
               top-level rule (API route), glob covering directory
  ```

  Positive: a folder or repository grant for `dotnet build` covers
  `dotnet build --output=bin/x`, `--configuration=Release`, and
  `dotnet format --include=src/*.cs`. Negative: it does not cover
  `dotnet build --output=../x`, `--output=$HOME/x` (Bash and PowerShell),
  `--output=/etc/x`, or `-p:OutDir=../x`. A chat grant and a grant for
  anywhere have no path scope, so they cover all of these. The separate word
  in `--output ../x` or `-o ../x` was already a path word. Free text that
  starts with `../` or `/` also prompts (`--message="../x y"`), as its
  separate word does.

  Known limits. The parser gives no general fact for these forms, and a split
  needs the grammar of the program, so they get no path scope
  (https://github.com/netclaw-dev/netclaw/issues/2383):
  - a short option with an attached value: `-o../x`, `-I/usr/include`;
  - text before the path in a value: `--data=@../x`, `--path=a:../b`,
    `--a=b=../x`, `--files=a,../b`, `"--logger=trx;LogFileName=../x.trx"`,
    `--output=file:///etc/x`;
  - a `name=value` word without a dash: `make PREFIX=../x`, `dd of=../x`,
    `dd of=~/x`, `/p:OutDir=../x`.
  - a PowerShell value that is relative to a drive: `--output=D:x`,
    `--output=a:..\b`;
  - a glob value in the folder whose match is a link to a file outside the
    folder: `--output=lsrc/*.cs`.

  A glob value with an expansion before its first glob character
  (`--output=$HOME/*.x`) has no fixed anchor. It gets the result of its
  separate path word: the command is exact.

  The protected-path check still reads each of these words.
- Breaks: `ResolveAuthorizationScope` treats the first operand of `find` and
  `cd` as a directory. That is private grammar of two executables.

### 6.5 Grants keyed by audience and tool

A grant applies only to the audience and the tool that it names. A shell grant
never authorizes `file_read`. See
[TA-8](../../openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md#requirement-ta-8-every-candidate-needs-coverage).

- Follows: `ToolApprovalActor` loads grants per `(audience, tool)`.
  `PathAccessPolicy` takes no grant as input.
- Breaks: a change that lets a folder grant for `cat` widen the file-tool roots.
  That change turns a shell consent into file authority.

### 6.6 Advice never grants authority

A correction tells the model how to author a better call. The better call
starts a new authorization attempt, which runs every check again.

- Follows: the managed temporary directory correction returns
  `RequiresAgentCorrection`. The model sends a new call, which passes every
  check again.
- Breaks: `IsEligiblePlatformTemporaryPath` relaxes a link check for causal
  intent. Advice data becomes an authority input.

### 6.7 Protection depends on the operation

A protected path has a rule per [file operation](../spec/GLOSSARY.md#file-operation).
One path can be readable and still be denied for write or for shell text.

- Follows: `file_read` of `netclaw.json` is allowed. A shell command that names
  `netclaw.json` is denied (`ToolPathPolicyTests`).
- Breaks: one "protected" flag for all operations. It either blocks the
  operator's own config reads or lets shell text write the config.

### 6.8 The outcome direction rule

A refactor keeps every outcome in the frozen case catalog. Only a named
fatigue-reduction change may move a case from "requires consent" to "allowed",
and it names a negative control that still prompts or denies.

| Change | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Allowed → other | Always blocks the merge. |
| Denied → other | Blocks the merge without owner approval. |
| RequiresApproval → Allowed | Only a listed intended change with a negative control. |
| RequiresApproval → Denied | Needs owner approval. |

- Follows: a PR lists case ID `X` in
  `approval-outcome-intended-changes.json`, moves it to `Allowed`, and names an
  external-directory case that still prompts.
- Breaks: a consolidation PR that changes an expected outcome in
  `ShellApprovalCaseCatalog.cs` and updates the snapshot in the same diff.

`scripts/check-approval-outcome-direction.py` enforces this rule in CI. See
[TOOLING.md § Outcome Direction Check](../../TOOLING.md#outcome-direction-check).

## 7. How to extend

Each recipe names the context that owns the change and the tests to add. Run
the approval boundary set and the outcome direction check for every recipe.

### 7.1 Add a candidate kind (a new tool family)

1. Admission: add the tool to the audience profile defaults and the schema.
   Add a `ToolOverrides` mode only when the default is wrong.
2. Consent: give the tool one candidate. Today a non-shell tool uses its tool
   name. `FilePathApprovalMatcher` shows the one path-scoped form today: a
   control-plane key for `file_write` and `file_edit`. In the daemon, the
   write-deny list denies the config directory before that key applies
   (consolidation plan D5, tier A). Do not copy that pattern for a new tool.
3. Consent delivery: confirm that the prompt shows a safe display text.

Tests: an Admission case per audience (see `McpToolAudienceGrantsTests`), a
consent case for each option that the prompt offers (`ToolApprovalGateTests`),
and a display redaction case.

### 7.2 Add a grant scope

1. Consent: add a case to `ApprovalGrantScope` and to `ApprovalDecision`. Add
   an option key in `ApprovalOptionKeys`. Keep the current key strings.
2. Consent: extend `ApprovalEntry`, the v3 codec, and `ApprovalPatternMatching`.
3. Filesystem authority: prove membership with a boundary check, not with text.
4. Consent delivery: render the new option in every channel.

Today this touches 8 or more encodings (section 3.5). **Planned:** after
consolidation PR 5, a new scope is one union case.

Tests: `RepositoryWorktreeApprovalTests`-style isolation (scope A never covers
B), a store round trip in `ToolApprovalActorTests`, a rehydration case in
`ApprovalRehydrationTests`, and a mutation target on the membership check.

### 7.3 Add a path boundary

1. Filesystem authority: add the root source to the catalog in
   `PathAccessPolicy` (`ResolveAndMergeRoots` or the session roots). State which
   audiences get it.
2. Choose the link rule on purpose: links below the root, links at or below the
   root, or links from the filesystem root.
3. Protected paths still win.

Tests: `UnattendedPathAccessTests` (attended and unattended reach are equal)
and `PublicAudienceFileAccessPolicyTests` style cases for each audience, a link escape case, a protected path case, and a
review of the path-access mutation target.

### 7.4 Add a deny rule

1. Prohibition: add structured `HardDenyRule` data, or add a built-in pattern
   in `ShellCommandPolicy` only when it is a general rule.
2. Do not add a parser for one executable. If the rule needs a shell fact that
   ShellSyntaxTree does not give, keep the input unresolved and propose a
   ShellSyntaxTree capability.

Tests: a deny row in `ShellApprovalCaseCatalog.cs` that also shows 0 approval
service calls, a compound or pipeline form of the same command, and a
`ShellCommandPolicyTests` case.

### 7.5 Add a channel prompt

1. Consent delivery: render the `ToolInteractionRequest` options with their
   keys. Keep labels within `ApprovalOptionKeys.MaxLabelLength` (76). Show a
   command of `ApprovalOptionKeys.MaxCommandTextChars` (900) characters in full.
2. Route the answer as a `ToolInteractionResponse` with the selected key.
3. Check the requester through `ApprovalButtonValueCodec`. Do not invent a
   second rule.
4. Add the channel type to `ChannelType.SupportsInteractiveApproval()` in
   [`ChannelType.cs`](../../src/Netclaw.Actors/Channels/ChannelType.cs) only
   when it can show a prompt and route the answer. A channel type that is not
   in that list fails closed for uncovered calls.

Tests: a prompt builder test (see the Slack, Discord, and Mattermost builder
tests), a requester-only test, a response parser test, and a rehydration test
for a prompt answered after restart. See also
[`docs/runbooks/adding-a-channel.md`](../runbooks/adding-a-channel.md).

## 8. Future scenarios and their support

Support levels:

- **Supported:** the design handles it without a new contract.
- **Needs a contract:** the design has a place for it, but a named contract is
  absent.
- **Not supported:** outside the design. The row gives the reason.
- **Planned:** an accepted decision that a named follow-up PR implements. It
  is not current behavior.

"Supported" describes where the change goes today. It does not mean that the
change is small.

| Scenario | Support | Where it goes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A fatigue fix for a new safe shell form (home-tilde glob, a literal loop) | Supported | Shell facts plus Consent, under the outcome direction rule (6.8). |
| A new grant scope, for example per project | Supported | One scope case and one path boundary (7.2, 7.3). Today it touches 8 or more encodings. |
| A new tool family or MCP resource type | Supported | A new candidate kind (7.1). |
| A new channel prompt surface (Teams, Telegram) | Supported | Consent delivery renders the consent request (7.5). |
| Skill-plugin script execution (decision D7) | Needs a contract | Declared scripts, per-file hashes, and a grant on plugin identity in Consent, plus a skill-resources path boundary. Today a skill script runs as an ordinary `shell_execute` call. The open plugin stack (#2160, #2161, #2162, #2157, #2158) gives plugins no execution authority and puts the managed plugin root on the shell deny list. |
| Typed allow, prompt, and deny rules as policy data (#1898) | Needs a contract | Consent data and Prohibition data. |
| Team approvers and verified automation approvers | Needs a contract | Consent delivery: who may answer, and how the answer is recorded. |
| OS-level sandbox or executor containment | Not supported | Netclaw has no executor boundary. It would plug in at Admission (a shell mode) and at launch (section 3.8). The `SandboxOnly` shell mode exists but always denies. |
| Close the `skill_manage` parent-directory check-to-use window | Not supported today | The temp file uses create-new semantics, so a link at the temp name fails. A same-user process that can already write where the daemon writes can still swap a parent directory. That gives no new authority today. With a sandboxed executor, fix it in Filesystem authority with directory-handle operations. |
| A missing or unreadable audience becomes an error (owner decision, September 29) | Planned | Today some components fall back to `Public` (TA-1). A follow-up code PR makes each such fallback fail loudly. Until that PR merges, the fallback stays as TA-1 describes it. |
| A consent for repository A that covers repository B | Not supported, by design | This is an invariant. A repository grant covers only registered worktrees of one Git common directory (TA-8). |

## 9. How we know it works

Each invariant has a proof that runs in CI. The spec has the full map per
rule in its "Verification Map" section. The mutation gates are in
[TOOLING.md § Focused Mutation Tests](../../TOOLING.md#focused-mutation-tests)
and the approval tooling is in
[TOOLING.md § Approval Contract Tooling](../../TOOLING.md#approval-contract-tooling).

| Invariant | Proof |
| --- | --- |
| Every catalog case keeps its outcome, reason, candidates, and options. | `ShellApprovalDispositionMatrixTests` with `ShellApprovalCaseCatalog.cs` and the `.verified.md` snapshot |
| An allowed case stays allowed. A denied case stays denied. | `scripts/check-approval-outcome-direction.py` (CI job "Approval Outcome Direction") |
| Hard deny runs before any grant lookup. | Catalog rows expect 0 approval service calls on deny |
| Launch re-checks the exact call. | `DispatchingToolExecutorLaunchTests` |
| A repository A grant never covers repository B. | `RepositoryWorktreeApprovalTests`; the approval directory mutation gate |
| A folder grant stays inside its folder. | Catalog link rows; `LinkTargetScopeApprovalTests`; the approval directory mutation gate |
| Audience and MCP allow lists deny before dispatch. | `McpToolAudienceGrantsTests`; the tool authorization mutation gate |
| Session roots follow the audience. | `PathAccessPolicy` tests; the path access mutation gate |
| Shell facts stay general. | The shell analysis and shell assignment mutation gates; `ShellPolicyEvidenceFixtureTests` |
| An unanswered request survives restart. | `ApprovalRehydrationTests`; `ShellApprovalLifecycleIntegrationTests` |
| Non-interactive runs cannot get new consent. | Evals Category 9 in `evals/run-evals.sh`; `evals/background_evals.py` |
| `skill_manage` mutations refuse links and protected paths. | `SkillToolTests`; the skill_manage guard mutation gate ([TOOLING.md § Skill Manage Guard Gate](../../TOOLING.md#skill-manage-guard-gate)) |
| A shell grant never authorizes `file_read`. | No test yet. Consolidation PR 1b adds it. |
| `ToolAuthorizer` gives the same decision as the gate on `dev`. | The corpus differential ([TOOLING.md § Authorization Corpus Differential](../../TOOLING.md#authorization-corpus-differential)) |
| One denied literal twin denies the call, and every twin candidate needs coverage (F1). | `LiteralTwinApprovalTests`; catalog `loop-twin*` rows; the literal twin mutation gate |
| A command that runs no program gets the decision of the file tool for each redirect. A prompt always names what it asks for. | `ShellNoProgramAuthorizationTests`; catalog `no-program-*` rows; the harness check in `ShellApprovalHarness.ObservePrompt`; the no program mutation gate ([TOOLING.md § No Program Gate](../../TOOLING.md#no-program-gate)) |
| No `ToolAuthorizer` rule can move ahead of an earlier rule. | The tool authorizer order mutation gate ([TOOLING.md § Tool Authorizer Order Gate](../../TOOLING.md#tool-authorizer-order-gate)) |

Model guidance (which tool the model should choose, and how it should declare
a project directory) is not an authorization rule, and no spec owns it. The
tool descriptions and `ToolChoiceGuidance` own that text, and evals Category 9
in `evals/run-evals.sh` measure its effect. A guidance change must not change
an authorization outcome; the case catalog and the outcome direction check
catch such a change.

Evidence fixtures live in
[`src/Netclaw.Security.Tests/Evidence/`](../../src/Netclaw.Security.Tests/Evidence/README.md).
`scripts/authorization-metrics.py` measures the size of the authorization path
(see [TOOLING.md § Authorization Metrics](../../TOOLING.md#authorization-metrics)).

## 10. Why it has this shape

The consolidation plan (tool authorization consolidation, accepted September
29, 2026) records the decisions. The main ones:

| Decision | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| D1 | Freeze the behavior files. Allowed stays allowed. Denied stays denied. The direction of change is fewer prompts. |
| D3 | Replace and delete one context per PR. No runtime shadow mode. |
| D4 | One authorizer for every tool. Grants stay keyed by tool. |
| D6 | One OpenSpec capability for the testable rules, and this document for people. |
| D7 | Skill-script authority is a separate, later capability. |
| D8 | Security fixes first. Soft freeze on new approval mechanisms during the code slices. |

History that shaped the current code:

- #2246 moved the approval evidence out of OpenSpec and added the outcome
  direction gate and the metrics script.
- #2224, #2225, and #2226 ordered the shell approval policy flow and merged
  approval policy models.
- #2122 added the shared authority check at process start (launch
  re-verification).
- The archived OpenSpec changes under `openspec/changes/archive/` hold the
  detailed history of each mechanism.
