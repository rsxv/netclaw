## Revision History

- **2026-02-21 (initial)**: PRDs 001-006 created for narrow "chat assistant
  with ACL" scope.
- **2026-02-21 (expanded)**: All PRDs revised to match expanded product vision.
  Netclaw is now an always-on autonomous operations agent. PRDs 007-009 added
  for local memory, scheduling, and input adapters.
- **2026-02-23 (architecture split)**: PRDs 001, 004, 009 revised for daemon +
  thin client architecture. Two binaries: `Netclaw.Daemon` (always-on service)
  and `Netclaw.Cli` (lightweight TUI/CLI client connecting via SignalR). Follows
  OpenClaw/IronClaw/PicoClaw architectural pattern. Daemon management commands
  added. Commands categorized as offline vs daemon-required.

## Traceability Rules

- Every engineering spec in `docs/spec/` must reference at least one PRD ID.
- Every OpenSpec change in `openspec/changes/` must include `Source PRDs`.
- Behavior changes cannot be implemented unless covered by either:
  - an existing PRD requirement, or
  - an explicit PRD update in the same planning cycle.

## Planned OpenSpec Capability Mapping

- Session and persistence -> `openspec/specs/netclaw-session/spec.md`
- Tool authorization (ACL, approval, and policy) -> `openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md`; architecture in `docs/architecture/tool-authorization.md`
- Operator UI -> `openspec/specs/netclaw-operator-ui/spec.md`
- CLI -> `openspec/specs/netclaw-cli/spec.md`
- Onboarding -> `openspec/specs/netclaw-onboarding/spec.md`
- Model providers -> `openspec/specs/netclaw-model-providers/spec.md`
- MCP tools -> `openspec/specs/netclaw-mcp/spec.md`
- Agent personality and memory -> `openspec/specs/netclaw-agent-memory/spec.md` (new)
- Scheduling -> `openspec/specs/netclaw-scheduling/spec.md` (new)
- Input adapters -> `openspec/specs/netclaw-input-adapters/spec.md` (new)
- Config hot-reload -> `openspec/specs/netclaw-config-hot-reload/spec.md` (new)
- First-party tools -> `openspec/specs/netclaw-tools/spec.md` (new)
