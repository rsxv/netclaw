# Test evidence fixtures

This folder is the stable home of the JSON evidence that the approval and
tool-friction tests read. Two test projects use it:

- `Netclaw.Security.Tests` includes the files in `Netclaw.Security.Tests.csproj`.
- `Netclaw.Actors.Tests` links the files in `Netclaw.Actors.Tests.csproj`.
  This project already links evidence model files from `Netclaw.Security.Tests`.

The build copies each file to the same output path as before the move. Test
code reads the files from the output directory, so the test code did not change:

| Output path | Source in this folder |
| --- | --- |
| `ApprovalEvidence/*.json` | `ApprovalEvidence/*.json` |
| `ToolFrictionEvidence/tool-friction-fixtures.json` | `ToolFrictionEvidence/tool-friction-fixtures.json` |
| `ToolFootprintEvidence/tool-schema-footprint-baseline.json` | `ToolFootprintEvidence/tool-schema-footprint-baseline.json` |

The tests hash the exact bytes of some files. The root `.gitattributes` keeps
every `*.json` file in this folder as LF on every platform. Do not remove that
rule.

`ShellApprovalEvidenceContractTests.Approval_evidence_contains_no_source_identity`
reads every `*.json` file in the `ApprovalEvidence` output folder. Put only
sanitized evidence in `ApprovalEvidence/`.

## History

These files are byte-identical copies of evidence from these OpenSpec change
folders:

- `openspec/changes/archive/2026-08-15-structure-shell-approval-policy/evidence/`
- `openspec/changes/archive/2026-09-29-reduce-fresh-session-approval-spam/evidence/`
- `openspec/changes/make-agent-tools-pit-of-success/evidence/`

The OpenSpec copies are historical records. The tests do not read them. Change
the files in this folder, not the OpenSpec copies. Tests must not load files
from `openspec/`, because an archive step moves or deletes change folders.
