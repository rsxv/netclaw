## Copyright Header Enforcement

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `scripts/Add-FileHeaders.ps1` | Add Petabridge copyright headers to all `.cs` files |
| `scripts/Add-FileHeaders.ps1 -Verify` | CI: check all files have headers (exit 1 if missing) |
| `scripts/Add-FileHeaders.ps1 -WhatIf` | Preview which files need headers |

## Focused Mutation Tests

All focused gates run in one job definition, `mutation-gates` in `pr_validation.yml`, on each pull request, merge group, and `dev` push.
The job has four Linux matrix groups that run in parallel with the normal test matrix.
The groups hold about 13 to 14 minutes of gates each. The sum of all gates is about 59 minutes of runner time. The job timeout is 25 minutes.
Each group runs its gates in sequence after one checkout and tool restore, and it reports every failed gate.
To add a gate, add its script name (`scripts/run-<name>-mutations.sh`) to the lightest group. Do not add a new job.

Focused mutation tests prove that deterministic tests reject a specific unsafe
change at a security or authority boundary. They do not measure general code
coverage. They do not replace positive and negative behavior tests.

### Current Targets

| Target | Protected claim | Expected mutants | Command |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|---------|
| `PathAccessPolicy.AddSessionRoots` and `PathAccessPolicy.IsReadableByAudience` | Only a Personal context receives shared session roots; a reviewed phrase uses the read authority of the audience, attended or not (D2), only for a fully qualified host path of the shell's own style that is not protected | 4 killed | `./scripts/run-path-access-mutations.sh` |
| `ToolAccessPolicy.AdmitMcpAudience` | Server and tool audience grants precede approval | 2 killed | `./scripts/run-tool-authorization-mutations.sh` |
| `ToolAccessPolicy.ScreenHardDeny` | A shell hard denial precedes approval | 1 killed | `./scripts/run-tool-authorization-mutations.sh` |
| `ShellGrantCandidateResult.IsFor` | Approval evidence keeps the requested candidate facts | 1 killed | `./scripts/run-tool-authorization-mutations.sh` |
| `ShellPolicyEvaluation.CandidateState.ValidateActorEvidence` | Actor evidence cannot replace existing candidate coverage (`Coverage != null`) | 1 killed | `./scripts/run-tool-authorization-mutations.sh` |
| `ToolAuthorizer` shell rule order (hard deny, trusted root, covering grant) | No rule can move ahead of an earlier rule: hard deny and today's trusted-root check precede a covering grant | 3 killed | `./scripts/run-tool-authorizer-order-mutations.sh` |
| Shell analysis, denial-only, tree effects, and reviewed-safe gates | Parser-proved regions and authored diagnostic syntax preserve hard denials; only bounded audited non-path values and consistent non-link-following tree facts can use reusable approval; a control-character word gets only the ancestor scope of its clean text; only a word below an absent top-level directory loses its path scope; an unresolved command is one exact candidate, and only decision D1 (an unknown operand with a safe phrase or a grant for anywhere, attended or not) covers it; a glob word gets the decision of each protected path that it can match (D5), and its link walk stays inside the covering directory; a bound value gets the hard-deny decision of its literal twin; a Bash test builtin is data only with proved operand values without `[`; a data command keeps its assignment digest unless each operand is proved data, and only such a data command with no redirect keeps its normal candidate after an unknown directory; a variable word that is not a path word is an unknown operand, so a folder grant cannot cover a loop or an assignment value outside the folder; an option value that the parser splits from its option (`--name=value`, `-p:Name=value`) and that can leave the working directory gets the scope of a path word with the same text, so a folder or repository grant cannot cover it; fixed text on stdin (a quoted heredoc or a proved here string) is data only on stdin and only for a receiver that is not a shell and has no argument that can name one | 330 killed | `./scripts/run-shell-command-analysis-mutations.sh` |
| Shell assignment identity, wrapper fallback, wrapper child source, hard-deny screen, syntax reconciliation, host mode, prompt rollback, and Bash sanitation | Reusable grants require exact facts, fallback wrappers and wrappers with an assignment prefix must stay one-time, a wrapper child source is the decoded argument value, unresolved Bash source and each list element meet the hard-deny screen, versioned prompts must fail closed, and strong modes require the reviewed launch contract; only an assignment that can reach the program qualifies a grant, a Bash data command keeps every assignment, and the parser names are the names of the one environment snapshot that each process receives (F3) | 81 killed | `./scripts/run-shell-assignment-mutations.sh` |
| Filesystem authority folder membership, repository identity, repository persistence, the folder of a new grant, and the link target scope | Folder and repository grants require candidate scope, identity, registration, and containment; a folder grant trusts its own root and refuses a link below it; a `..` after a link makes the shell scope unresolved; a word that names a link also has the scope of its final target, and a target after a `..` that leaves a link is unknown (#2375); a new folder grant uses the directory where its occurrence runs | 24 killed | `./scripts/run-approval-directory-mutations.sh` |
| `ReminderManagerActor.HandleExecutionOutcomeAsync` | Only the current attempt can settle; the manager replies after settlement | 2 killed | `./scripts/run-reminder-execution-mutations.sh` |
| `ActiveExecutionTracker.TryRemove` | Only the current owner can remove its guard; cleanup removes that guard | 2 killed | `./scripts/run-reminder-execution-mutations.sh` |
| `McpArtifactMaterializer.TryAdmit` | Scanner approval and verified MIME both precede MCP artifact storage | 4 killed | `./scripts/run-mcp-artifact-admission-mutations.sh` |
| `SkillManageTool.GuardMutationTarget` and the filesystem authority link and protection results | A skill mutation cannot follow a link, write a protected path, or skip the atomic-write temp file | 5 killed | `./scripts/run-skill-manage-guard-mutations.sh` |
| `ToolAccessPolicy.ReadOnlyOccurrences`, the read relaxation in `ToolAccessPolicy.EnforceKnownShellPaths`, `PathAccessPolicy.EvaluateShellReadPath`, `FileSystemAuthority.HoldsReadProtectedPath`, and the read-operand exemption of the `ToolPathPolicy` text screen | Decision D6: a read-only shell program (`cat`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `grep`, `jq`, `diff`) with bounded arguments can read one exact config file; only a write-protected path gets read protection; a redirect that writes keeps write protection; a directory operand that holds a read-protected path, a plain word that names an entry, a glob, a brace or `$'...'` word, a `..`, the config directory itself, and program text that names it in any spelling (`//`, `/./`, `name/../`, split quotes) stay denied | 58 killed | `./scripts/run-shell-config-read-mutations.sh` |
| `ToolApprovalEntryComparer.CoversCommandWords`, `ShellPolicyCoordinator.SelectCommandWordsCorrection`, `ShellApprovalMatcher.TryResolveProgramPath`, `ShellProgramPath.MatchesLegacyRelative`, `ShellApprovalMatcher.ProjectCommandWords`, `ShellGrantFileWords.TryFindEntry`, and `ToolPathPolicy.PlainWordLinkReachesDeniedPath` | A verb grant (two or more words) covers its command words and any later words, and a program-only grant covers its word alone, so a `gh` grant does not cover `gh auth logout`; an empty grant covers nothing; the matcher and the store hygiene use this one rule; Unknown command words get a rewrite correction; a program path names its file (R1), so a `./tool` grant does not cover another file named `tool` or `mytool`; a word after the verb slot that names an existing file or directory leaves the command words and becomes a path scope, while the program word, the verb slot, a link, a word without a file, and a word that is not one entry of the directory stay; a plain word that names a link to a protected path is denied, command word or argument; the store and the doctor use the same rule | 53 detected | `./scripts/run-exact-verb-chain-mutations.sh` |
| `ShellCommandAnalysis.IsPlainFileTarget` and `ToolAccessPolicy.ScreenNoProgramRedirects` | Owner decision (October 2026): a command that runs no program gets no prompt only when each redirect target is one plain file (`/dev/null` is the only path below `/dev/`, so `/dev/tcp` keeps a prompt); a redirect target that is not proved, an input redirect that the `file_read` rules refuse, and a `Deny` mode of the file tool deny the call | 20 killed | `./scripts/run-no-program-mutations.sh` |
| `BashLiteralTwinSlices.Apply` and the denial check of `ToolAccessPolicy.ScreenScopedSlices` | Decision F1: the strictest literal twin result decides a call. The candidates of every twin replace the candidates of their source command, an unresolved source keeps its exact answer, twins without their source command fail loudly, and one denied twin denies the call | 9 killed | `./scripts/run-literal-twin-mutations.sh` |

Run the path-access check locally:

```bash
./scripts/run-path-access-mutations.sh
```

The script tests two mutants in the shared session-root boundary and two
mutants in the read branch of the reviewed-safe path check.
`Reviewed_shell_path_uses_the_read_authority_of_the_audience` kills the
branch mutants: a relative path and a protected path must not qualify, and an
attended and an unattended read get the same decision (D2). The job fails
unless all four mutants die.
The approval taxonomy PR 1 run took 3 minutes after package restore.
The local prototype took 1 minute 28 seconds after package restore.
A cold CI runner should take two to four minutes.

The harness uses xUnit 2 because Stryker's VSTest adapter does not support xUnit 3 correctly.
The script requires `perl` and `jq`, which the Linux CI image supplies.

### No Program Gate

Run the gate for commands that run no program:

```bash
./scripts/run-no-program-mutations.sh
```

The script runs Stryker two times. The first run selects the target check of
`ShellCommandAnalysis.IsPlainFileTarget` (5 mutants). A mutant that drops the
`/dev/` check lets `printf x > /dev/tcp/host/port` run with no prompt. The
second run selects the redirect checks of
`ToolAccessPolicy.ScreenNoProgramRedirects` (15 mutants). A mutant
there lets `: < /etc/passwd` run for an audience that may not read that path,
or lets a redirect run when `file_write` has the `Deny` mode.
`NoProgramMutationTests` must kill all of them. A missing or duplicated span
fails before Stryker starts.

The local run took about 4 minutes after package restore, while another build
ran. CI runs it in the `approval-and-authorization` group of the
`mutation-gates` job. Its report directory is `artifacts/stryker/no-program`.

### MCP Artifact Admission Gate

Run the MCP artifact admission gate:

```bash
./scripts/run-mcp-artifact-admission-mutations.sh
```

The script selects the two fail-closed checks in
`McpArtifactMaterializer.TryAdmit`. It requires two killed mutants for scanner
approval and two killed mutants for verified MIME presence.

The tests supply inconsistent scanner results on purpose. One result has a
verified MIME with an explicit rejection. The other has approval without a
verified MIME. Neither result can authorize storage.

The source selector rejects a missing or duplicate boundary before Stryker
starts. The gate also rejects a changed mutant count, a survivor, or a compile
error in the selected span.

The local run took 1 minute 40 seconds after package restore. The separate CI
job retains a 10-minute timeout and uploads `mcp-artifact-admission-mutation-report`.

### Tool Authorization Gate

Run the tool authorization gate:

```bash
./scripts/run-tool-authorization-mutations.sh
```

The script selects three conditions in `ToolAccessPolicy`.
Each mutant removes a logical negation.
The script requires one killed mutant at each selected source location and exactly three tested mutants overall.
The gate fails if a target is absent, survives, exceeds its time limit, or cannot compile.
Stryker can report unrelated compiler errors before it applies the source filter.
Those errors do not count as tested mutants.

The tests use the real dispatcher, MCP adapter, and shell policy coordinator.
Local probe tools count calls without an MCP connection or a host process.
Public and Team cases cover both MCP grant layers under Auto and one-time approval.
Personal cases cover shell hard denial under both modes.
Auto cases test forbidden calls before their permitted controls.
Approval cases first prove that the same approval keys permit the call.
Each denial must preserve the probe call count.

These tests preserve PRD-002 SEC-003 and PRD-006 MCP-003.
See [TA-3 (audience admission)](openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md#requirement-ta-3-audience-profiles-admit-tools) and
[TA-5 (hard deny)](openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md#requirement-ta-5-hard-deny-precedes-grant-lookup-and-repeats-at-launch)
in the tool authorization contract.
The gate covers authorization before dispatch. It does not prove MCP transport or native shell containment.

The final local run took 88 seconds after package restore.
The authorization PR 4 re-run killed the same 3 + 2 mutants in about 5 minutes.
The separate CI job retains a 10-minute timeout and uploads `tool-authorization-mutation-report`.
Its report directory is `artifacts/stryker/tool-authorization`.

### Tool Authorizer Order Gate

Run the rule-order gate of the linear authorizer:

```bash
./scripts/run-tool-authorizer-order-mutations.sh
```

`ToolAuthorizer` (authorization PR 6a) states its rule order as one
`decision ??= Rule(call);` line per rule (`decision ??= await RuleAsync(call, ct);`
for a rule that reads the grant store). The script selects three lines of the
shell rule list: hard deny, the trusted-root check, and the covering grant.
Stryker turns `??=` into `=` on each line. The rule then runs after an earlier
decision and replaces it, so the rule moves ahead of every earlier rule. The
script requires one killed mutant on each line and three tested mutants overall.
A missing or duplicated rule line fails before Stryker starts.

`ToolAuthorizerOrderMutationTests` kills the mutants. A covering grant exists in
every case:

- A hard-denied phrase stays denied. A control with a granted phrase is allowed.
- A Team audience stays denied. No later rule can clear an admission denial.

The same class pins decision D2. A stored grant covers a readable path outside
the project, attended or not, with the ordinary stored-grant reason. A bounded
(`Roots`) write profile keeps the trusted-root denial ahead of a covering grant
for both run kinds. Without a grant, an unattended call is denied with
`approval_required_unattended`. The negative controls stay denied: Auto mode
under a bounded profile, and a protected path with a grant.

The tests pick the host shell and a temporary root without links, so they also
pass in the normal Windows and macOS test jobs. The local run took about
2 minutes after package restore. CI runs it in the `shell-analysis` group of the
`mutation-gates` job. Its report directory is
`artifacts/stryker/tool-authorizer-order`.

### Exact Verb Chain Gate

Run the exact verb chain gate:

```bash
./scripts/run-exact-verb-chain-mutations.sh
```

The script runs Stryker seven times. The first run selects the length checks in
`ToolApprovalEntryComparer.CoversCommandWords` (11 mutants). A verb grant (two
or more words) covers its words and any later words, and a program-only grant
covers its word alone. A mutant that drops the one-word check lets a `gh` grant
cover `gh auth logout`. A mutant of the shorter-list check lets a grant cover
fewer words than it names, and a mutant of the empty check lets an empty grant
cover any call. The approval matcher and the store hygiene share this rule. The
second run selects the return of
`ShellPolicyCoordinator.SelectCommandWordsCorrection` (three mutants). A
mutant that drops the rewrite correction turns a bare-glob call back into a
prompt or a denial. The third run selects the return of
`ShellApprovalMatcher.TryResolveProgramPath` (four mutants). A mutant that
skips the join with the working directory lets a `./tool` grant cover any file
named `tool`. The fourth run selects the `/` boundary of
`ShellProgramPath.MatchesLegacyRelative` (one mutant). Without it, an older
`./tool` grant covers `mytool`. The fifth run selects
`ShellApprovalMatcher.ProjectCommandWords` (six mutants): a file word leaves
the command words, and a link word stays. The sixth run selects
`ShellGrantFileWords.TryFindEntry` (16 mutants). The seventh run selects
`ToolPathPolicy.PlainWordLinkReachesDeniedPath` and
`ToolPathPolicy.FindLinkWords`, the one loop that the screen shares with the
link scopes of #2375 (12 mutants): a plain
word that names a link to a protected path is denied, command word or
argument, and the program word does not count. `ExactVerbChainMutationTests` and
`ToolAuthorizerOrderMutationTests` must detect all of them. A missing or
duplicated span fails before Stryker starts.

The local run took about 1 minute after package restore. CI runs it in the
`verb-chain-and-reminder` group of the `mutation-gates` job. Its report
directory is `artifacts/stryker/exact-verb-chain`.

### Approval Directory Gate

Run the approval directory gate:

```bash
./scripts/run-approval-directory-mutations.sh
```

The script reuses the xUnit 2 harness.
It selects thirteen security source regions, three approval actor conditions, and the folder rule of the grant builder.
Folder containment and link checks are in the filesystem authority
(`src/Netclaw.Security/Authorization/Filesystem`). Bash and PowerShell grants use
the same containment rule and the same link walker, so one containment target
replaces the two shell-specific targets.

| Decision | Expected mutants |
|----------|------------------|
| Folder containment (`FileSystemAuthority`, both shells) | 1 killed: remove the logical negation |
| Folder link rule starts below the grant root (`LinkRule.BelowRoot`) | 1 killed: include the root in the link check |
| Link rejection result | 2 killed: force either conditional outcome |
| Candidate repository scope and identity | 3 killed: force a result or relax the identity check |
| Parent segment after a link, matcher gate (`ShellApprovalMatcher`) | 1 killed: negate the condition |
| Parent segment after a link, link test (`FileSystemAuthority`) | 2 killed: negate the test or include the anchor |
| Link scopes of a path word (`ShellApprovalMatcher.TryAddLinkScopes`, #2375) | 1 killed: remove the logical negation |
| Lexical scope of a path word that names no link (`ShellApprovalMatcher`) | 1 killed: remove the logical negation |
| Link scopes of a plain link word (`ShellApprovalMatcher`) | 1 killed: remove the logical negation |
| Link folder scope (`ShellApprovalMatcher.TryAddLinkScopes`) | 2 killed: remove the statement or use the link itself as the folder |
| Unknown target after a `..` that leaves a link (`FileSystemAuthority.FollowLinkChain`) | 1 killed: negate the test |
| Common identity across candidates (`RepositoryIdentity`) | 1 killed: remove the logical negation |
| Reciprocal worktree registration (`RepositoryIdentity`) | 1 killed: remove the logical negation |
| Persistence candidate resolution | 1 killed: remove the logical negation |
| Persistence common identity | 1 killed: remove the logical negation |
| Persistence worktree root | 1 killed: remove the logical negation |
| Folder of a new grant (`GrantBuilder`, `candidate.Directory ?? workingDirectory`) | 3 killed: swap the operands or keep only one side |

The script requires these counts at their exact source locations and 24 tested mutants overall (18 Security, 6 Actors).
It fails if a target is absent, survives, exceeds its time limit, or cannot compile.
The source selector rejects an absent or duplicate boundary before Stryker starts.
This protects the gate when the authorization code and diagnostic code contain similar conditions.

Twenty-three cases exercise the approval matcher and persistence gate with real directories and links.
They cover the grant root, normal descendants, sibling prefixes, traversal, relative paths, and candidate scope that differs from cwd.
One case proves that a grant root which is itself a link still covers its children (R3).
One case proves that a `..` after a link voids the grant, and that a `..` after a real directory or below a root alias keeps it.
One case proves that a folder grant covers a link word only when it covers the link folder and the final target (#2375). It uses a path word, with and without a file extension, on every host and a plain word on POSIX hosts.
The repository cases cover candidate resolution, mixed identities, reciprocal registration, and a nested registered worktree.
The link cases prove that the link reaches the sibling directory before they require denial.
Windows path cases cover case rules, drive boundaries, and traversal on every host.
The native filesystem cases select Bash on POSIX hosts and PowerShell on Windows.
The Linux mutation job runs the shared link walker on POSIX links only; the ordinary Windows test job exercises Windows links.

The matcher shares `EvaluateApprovalScope` with `ToolApprovalActor` and shell approval evidence validation.
The three persistence targets are in `ToolApprovalActor.TryCreateEntry`. It reads the repository from `GrantScope.Repository` and the builder's worktree from `ToolApprovalGrant.RepositoryWorktree`.
The grant builder target protects the directory proof of a `cd` list: each folder grant uses the directory of its own occurrence (for example `cd@/work/sub`), and a candidate without a directory uses the call directory, not "everywhere". `Folder_grant_uses_the_directory_where_each_occurrence_runs` kills all three mutants.
These tests preserve PRD-002 SEC-003 and
[TA-8 of the tool authorization contract](openspec/specs/tool-authorization/spec.md#requirement-ta-8-every-candidate-needs-coverage).
They prove folder-grant decisions. They do not prove native process containment or races between authorization and file access.

The final local run took less than four minutes after package restore.
The separate CI job retains a 10-minute timeout and uploads `approval-directory-mutation-report`.
Its report directory is `artifacts/stryker/approval-directory`.
The durable actor report is below its `actor` directory.

### Reminder Execution Gate

Run the reminder execution gate:

```bash
./scripts/run-reminder-execution-mutations.sh
```

The script reuses the xUnit 2 harness and selects four mutations:

| Boundary | Expected mutant |
|----------|-----------------|
| Manager outcome ownership | Reverse the execution-ID comparison |
| Manager acceptance reply | Remove the reply from `finally` |
| Tracker removal ownership | Reverse the execution-ID comparison |
| Tracker guard cleanup | Remove the dictionary removal |

Each location must produce one killed mutant. The report must contain exactly four tested mutants.
The gate fails if a target is absent, ignored, survives, exceeds its time limit, or cannot compile.
The selector rejects absent or duplicate source markers before Stryker starts.
Unrelated compiler errors do not count as tested mutants.

Seven cases use the real manager, execution tracker, actor mailbox, definition store, and history store.
An isolated host supplies the local Akka.Reminders scheduler with an in-memory store.
The fixture observes execution IDs through the existing dispatch event and holds the session pipeline on a task.
Actor replies provide barriers. The tests use no delay or sleep to wait for state.

The stale-message cases complete attempt A, start attempt B, and replay A's completion or termination.
They require B's guard, history, failure count, and alerts to remain unchanged.
A current-termination control must record the failure and release its guard.
Success and failure cases require the correct acceptance ID, history, failure count, and subsequent dispatch.
A directory at the atomic-write path causes a real save failure; cleanup and the acceptance reply must still occur.

These tests preserve PRD-008 SCHED-005 and SCHED-007.
See [the execution and settlement contract](openspec/specs/netclaw-scheduling/spec.md) and
[the history contract](openspec/specs/reminder-execution-history/spec.md).
The fixture injects internal outcome messages and synthetic envelopes.
It does not prove the child outcome producer, durable scheduler settlement, restart recovery, or external delivery.

Stryker 5.0.0 omits statement removal when the statement contains an `out` keyword.
It also filters the complete `finally` deletion when the acceptance-reply mutant exists.
Thus, the cleanup mutant targets the tracker dictionary, not the manager's `TryRemove` call.
An explicit local deletion of that call must also make the cleanup cases fail before this gate changes.

The final local run took 95 seconds after package restore.
The separate CI job retains a 10-minute timeout and uploads `reminder-execution-mutation-report`.
Its report directory is `artifacts/stryker/reminder-execution`.

### Skill Manage Guard Gate

Run the skill_manage guard gate:

```bash
./scripts/run-skill-manage-guard-mutations.sh
```

The script reuses the xUnit 2 harness. `SkillManageTool.GuardMutationTarget`
asks the filesystem authority for the link and protection decisions, so two
targets are in `FileSystemAuthority` (project `Netclaw.Security`) and one is in
`SkillManageTool` (project `Netclaw.Actors`):

| Decision | Expected mutants |
|----------|------------------|
| Link check result | 2 killed: force either conditional outcome |
| Protected-path check result | 2 killed: force either conditional outcome |
| Atomic-write temp file | 1 killed: remove the statement that adds `<target>.tmp` to the checked paths |

The claims did not change. The count changed from three to five because each
authority result is a conditional expression. Stryker tests "always" and
"never" for it, where the earlier `if` call had one negation. The approval
directory gate also covers the shared link result line.
Each location must produce its killed mutants, and each report must contain
exactly that many tested mutants.
The gate fails if a marker is absent or duplicated, a mutant survives, or a mutant cannot compile.

Four cases use a real temp skills tree and the production `DaemonToolPathPolicyFactory` deny list.
A control write must succeed. A write through a linked directory, a write through a link at
`<target>.tmp`, and a flat-file skill write into `.system` must fail and leave outside files unchanged.

The gate omits the inspection-failure branch (`PathDecision.Unverifiable`). No
deterministic test can make the link walker fail yet, so a mutant that allows on
error would survive.
The gate does not prove the absence of a race between the check and the write.

The local run took 1 minute 54 seconds after package restore.
The separate CI job retains a 10-minute timeout and uploads `skill-manage-guard-mutation-report`.
Its report directory is `artifacts/stryker/skill-manage-guard`.

### Shell Analysis Gate

Run the shell analysis gate:

```bash
./scripts/run-shell-command-analysis-mutations.sh
```

The script tests 330 mutants across execution-region accounting, denial-only
matching, tree traversal and root correspondence, bounded non-filesystem
values, data operands of output commands and test builtins, candidate extraction, approval
mode, path facts, and reviewed-safe policy. The job fails unless every mutant
dies.

Approval taxonomy PR 2 adds the Bash data-operand rule: a dynamic operand of
`echo`, `printf`, `:`, `true`, or `false` is data. Three mutants cover the
grammar and verb check and two cover its use in `CommandHasDynamicSyntax`.
`Dynamic_value_is_data_only_in_an_output_operand` and
`Power_shell_output_alias_keeps_a_dynamic_value_unresolved` kill them: a
substitution in an `echo` operand keeps the candidates, and a dynamic operand
of `cat`, a dynamic program word, a dynamic redirect target, or a PowerShell
`echo` stays unresolved. PowerShell keeps the bare `$?` rule (2 mutants);
`Power_shell_bare_status_output_keeps_static_candidates` kills them. The gate
kills 75 Security and 9 Actors mutants (3.5 minutes).

Approval taxonomy PR 3 adds `ShellApprovalMatcher.ResolveControlCharacterScope`
(4 mutants). A word with a control character, such as multi-line
`python3 -c` code, gets the deepest ancestor directory of its text before the
first control character. `Control_character_word_gets_its_clean_ancestor_scope`
kills the mutants. The gate now kills 79 Security and 9 Actors mutants.

Approval taxonomy PR 4 adds `ShellApprovalMatcher.HasAbsentTopLevelDirectory`
(3 mutants). An absolute word below a top-level directory that does not exist
on the host, such as the `gh api` route `/repos/o/r/actions/jobs/1/logs`, has
no path scope. The probe runs only when the working directory exists on the
host. `Absent_top_level_word_has_no_path_scope` kills the mutants. The gate
now kills 82 Security and 9 Actors mutants.

Approval taxonomy PR 5 (per-command judgment) adds 7 Security and 19 Actors
mutants. The Security targets are the directory guard of
`ShellApprovalMatcher.ExtractCommandCandidates` (a command after an unproved
directory change is exact) and the part of `CreateExactCandidate`. The Actors
targets are the D1 grant filter (`ShellPolicyCoordinator.KeepUnknownOperandGlobalGrants`),
the interactive switch (`ToolAccessPolicy.WithCommandCandidates`), the "Once"
only rule of `HasReusableShellPhrase`, and the D1 rule of
`ReviewedSafeShellPolicy`. `PerCommandJudgmentMutationTests` kills them with
the real authorizer: a folder or chat grant, an unknown redirect target, a
glob scope, a link, a known outside path, and an unattended call keep the
prompt or the denial. The data-operand target moved into
`ClassifyUnresolvedPart`. The gate now kills 89 Security and 28 Actors mutants.

Approval taxonomy PR 6 (owner decision D2) replaces the blanket kill denial
with `ShellCommandPolicy.DaemonProcessKillDenyPattern` (3 mutants). A kill is
denied only when an operand names the Netclaw daemon.
`Only_a_kill_that_names_the_daemon_is_hard_denied` kills the mutants: a kill
of a process ID or a test server stays allowed by the hard-deny list, and a
kill that names `netclaw` stays denied. The gate now kills 92 Security and 28
Actors mutants.

The ShellSyntaxTree 0.4.0-beta.17 update adds 74 Security mutants in three
targets. `GlobPolicyMutationTests` kills them on the Bash 5.2 host:

- Decision D5 (option A): `ToolPathPolicy.GlobMayReachDeniedPath` and the
  `ShellGlobScope` segment match. A glob word that can match a protected path,
  the default credential store, or a directory that contains one, gets the
  literal-path denial. A dot entry, a bracket expression, and case are covered.
- `ShellGlobScope.IsLinkContained`: the link walk for a glob in a directory
  segment, with its bound of 4096 directories.
- `ShellCommandPolicy.EvaluateEffectiveValues`: a word that reads a binding,
  such as `x=/; rm -rf "$x"`, gets the hard-deny decision of its literal twin.
  A loop variable checks each combination, and more than 256 combinations deny.

The gate now kills 166 Security and 28 Actors mutants.

Decision D2 (an unattended run uses the audience policy of a chat) removes the
attended-only condition of `ToolAccessPolicy.WithCommandCandidates`, and with it
one Actors mutant. `PerCommandJudgmentMutationTests` now shows that an
unattended call gets the D1 decision of a chat, and is denied where a chat
would prompt. The gate now kills 166 Security and 27 Actors mutants.

The test builtin rule extends two targets, `HasOnlyDataOperands` and
`ClassifyUnresolvedPart`. It adds four targets: `HasTestBuiltinVerb`,
`HasBoundedNameSafeValue` with `HasNoSubscript`,
`ShellVerbPolicyData.IsDataCommand`, and
`ShellApprovalMatcher.TryCreateAssignmentDigest`.
`Test_builtin_operand_is_data_only_with_a_bounded_value_without_a_subscript`
kills them: a proved operand without `[` is data, and an operand with `[`, an
unknown value, or a glob file name is not. A data command with a redirect keeps
its assignment digest. `Power_shell_test_word_is_not_a_data_command` kills the
Bash condition. The gate now kills 183 Security and 27 Actors mutants. The local
run took 9 minutes 45 seconds.

The review of #2344 adds `HasProvedDataOperands` and `IsOneDoubleQuotedWord`.
A Bash data command keeps its assignment digest unless each operand has a
proved value or is one double-quoted raw word (a test operand needs a proved
value without `[`). `Test_builtin_operand_is_data_only_with_a_bounded_value_without_a_subscript`
and `One_double_quoted_word_has_no_unescaped_inner_quote` kill the new mutants.
The gate now kills 211 Security and 27 Actors mutants.

The ShellSyntaxTree 0.4.0-beta.19 update replaces `IsOneDoubleQuotedWord` with
the parser fact `MayPathnameExpand`, and it adds `HasUnboundedPathnameExpansion`
and `HasGlobFreeAuthoredValue` as targets. `Unknown_word_that_can_glob_is_not_data`
kills their mutants: a quoted or glob-free word is data or keeps decision D1,
and an unknown word that can glob makes its command one exact candidate.
`Glob_free_authored_value_has_nothing_to_expand` kills the mutants of the glob
character check. An output operand no longer needs the separate proved-value
test, because a proved value without a glob character already passes. Owner
decision (#2349) exempts Bash data commands (`echo`, `printf`, `test`, `[`)
from the exact-candidate rule; the `echo` rows and the `git log -n $?` rows
kill the new mutants. `IsProvedValueDenied` is also a target:
`Decoded_word_gets_the_decision_of_its_proved_value` kills its mutants with
decoded ANSI-C paths. The gate now kills 214 Security and 27 Actors mutants.

The heredoc parity change (owner decision 2026-10-07) adds five targets (24
mutants): the heredoc and here-string arms of `HasUnresolvedRedirect`,
`HasFixedTextStdin` with `CanTakeFixedStdinText` and `HasShellReceiver`,
`MayNameScriptShell`, the expansion-mode check of `HasLiteralHereDocument`, and
`ShellVerbPolicyData.IsScriptShellProgram`. A quoted heredoc or a proved here
string on stdin is data. These forms stay unresolved:

- an expanding heredoc, an unknown here string, and another descriptor;
- a command with Unknown command words;
- a shell receiver, by the file name of each verb word;
- an argument with a part that is a shell file name, or with no proved value.

`Fixed_stdin_text_is_data_only_for_a_receiver_that_is_not_a_shell` and
`Fixed_stdin_text_fails_closed_for_an_argument_that_can_name_a_shell` kill the
mutants. The gate now kills 303 Security and 27 Actors mutants.

The script groups targets by source project. Stryker analyzes each source project once.
The local run on 2026-09-24 took under four minutes.

Scope review for authorization PR 4 (shell facts): ShellSyntaxTree now supplies
the approval units, the candidate verbs, and the bundled-wrapper child source.
No marker moved, and the counts did not change (72 Security and 9 Actors
mutants killed; the run took 5 minutes). The raw-text hard-deny scan for
unresolved input moved to `LegacyShellTextScan` without a change to its
algorithm. The owner kept it (2026-09-30), and a parser screen now adds a
hard-deny check of each Bash list element. Neither has a focused target:
`HardDenyParityCorpusTests` pins the kept denials and the four stricter
background-list cases. The gate re-run after the screen killed the same 81
mutants. The cd projection merge re-pointed the `IsMessy` marker to its new
signature (it now takes the link rule); the same 72 Security and 9 Actors
mutants die. CI allows 30 minutes for
hosted-runner variance and report upload. The report directory is
`artifacts/stryker/shell-command-analysis`.

### Shell Assignment Gate

Run the shell assignment gate:

```bash
./scripts/run-shell-assignment-mutations.sh
```

The script tests 71 mutants across twelve narrow boundaries.
It covers grant identity, wrapper fallback, wrapper child source, the hard-deny screen, prompt rollback, reviewed-safe exclusion, source spans, Bash host selection, and environment sanitation.
The prompt rollback target is `ConsentAnswerCodec.IsOffered` in `src/Netclaw.Actors/Authorization/Consent/ConsentAnswer.cs`.
It decides whether the prompt offered the selected option key before the key becomes a `ConsentAnswer`.
The job fails unless every mutant dies.

The local calibration run took about five minutes after package restore.
CI allows 15 minutes for hosted-runner variance and report upload.
The report directory is `artifacts/stryker/shell-assignment`.
The authorization PR 4 re-run killed the same 41 Security and 15 Actors
mutants in about 4 minutes. The wrapper fallback target still covers the
parser-decoded child source.

The ShellSyntaxTree 0.4.0-beta.17 update keeps 56 Security and 15 Actors
mutants. The hard-deny screen target now also requires a complete parse: a
parse that stops at a `bash -lc` child after a `cd` that can fail screens each
list element again. The `Wrapper_child_source_is_the_decoded_argument_value`
input moved from a background list, which now parses, to arithmetic
expansion, which does not.

### Scope Review

Review the target list after each security fix or authority policy change.
Also review it as part of each minor release.

Add one focused target when all these conditions apply:

- The code controls authorization, isolation, privacy, identity, destructive access, or execution ownership and cleanup.
- A plausible mutation represents a specific unsafe behavior.
- Deterministic tests reject that mutation.
- A narrow source span contains the relevant decision.
- Stryker produces stable, meaningful mutants for that span.
- Its matrix group stays below the job timeout and finishes before the Windows test job.

Use this procedure:

1. State the protected claim and the unsafe mutation.
2. Apply the mutation in a disposable worktree.
3. Confirm that the applicable tests fail for the expected reason.
4. Configure Stryker for the smallest source span that contains the decision.
5. Pin the expected mutant count and require each mutant to die.
6. Record the target, claim, count, command, and measured cost in this section.
7. Split the target into a parallel job if the total job approaches its timeout.

Do not add a broad project scan. Broad scans can produce equivalent mutants,
long runs, and invalid results from the current xUnit 3 adapter path.

Review these candidate boundaries before lower-risk code:

1. Additional native-tool and structured-path decisions in `ToolAccessPolicy`.
2. Additional approval scope decisions, including the native Windows link branch.
3. Shell hard-deny decisions in `ShellCommandPolicy`.
4. Slack, Discord, and Mattermost ACL decisions.
5. Device bearer token authentication.

## Approval Contract Tooling

These tools protect the shell approval contract during the tool authorization
consolidation. They need only `python3` (standard library) and `git`.

### Evidence Fixtures

The approval and tool-friction evidence JSON is in
`src/Netclaw.Security.Tests/Evidence/`. Both `Netclaw.Security.Tests` and
`Netclaw.Actors.Tests` read it. Tests must not load files from `openspec/`,
because an archive step moves change folders. The folder README lists each
file and the tests that read it.

### Outcome Direction Check

`scripts/check-approval-outcome-direction.py` compares the `Result` column of
the review snapshot
`src/Netclaw.Actors.Tests/Tools/ShellApprovalDispositionMatrixTests.Shell_approval_cases_match_review_table.verified.md`
with the same file at a baseline revision. It keys rows by section heading and
case ID.

| Change | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `Allowed` to other | Fails unless an intended change has `approvedBy` and names a negative control. |
| `RequiresAgentCorrection` to `Allowed` | Fails unless an intended change names a negative control. |
| `RequiresAgentCorrection` to `Denied` | Fails unless an intended change has `approvedBy`. |
| `RequiresApproval` to or from `RequiresAgentCorrection` | Passes. Neither outcome runs the call. |
| `Denied` to other | Fails unless an intended change has `approvedBy`. |
| `RequiresApproval` to `Allowed` | Fails unless an intended change names a negative control. |
| `RequiresApproval` to `Denied` | Fails unless an intended change has `approvedBy`. |
| Case removed | Always fails. |
| Case added | Passes. The check reports it. |
| Case renamed | Needs an intended change with `renamedFrom`. The check compares the old `Result` with the new `Result` under the rules above. |

A negative control is a case ID in the same section. The case must exist in the
baseline and in the candidate snapshot. It must prompt or deny in both. Only the
owner can give `approvedBy`. A table header that repeats a column name is bad
input.

Owner review: a change to the intended-changes file, to the check script, or to
its CI job always needs owner review. Such a PR is never an automatic merge.

List intended changes in
`src/Netclaw.Actors.Tests/Tools/approval-outcome-intended-changes.json`:

```json
{
  "changes": [
    {
      "section": "Fresh Personal approval matrix",
      "id": "<case ID>",
      "from": "RequiresApproval",
      "to": "Allowed",
      "reason": "<why the change is safe>",
      "negativeControl": "<case ID that still prompts or denies>",
      "approvedBy": "<owner, when the rule needs it>",
      "renamedFrom": "<old case ID, only for a renamed case>"
    }
  ]
}
```

For a rename, the old ID must be in the baseline only, and the new ID must be in
the candidate only. A rename with no outcome change uses the same value for
`from` and `to`.

The check fails when a new entry matches no transition (stale entry). An entry
that is also in the baseline version of the file is history. The check ignores
it, and it does not justify a new transition.

```bash
python3 scripts/check-approval-outcome-direction.py                       # merge base of HEAD and origin/dev
python3 scripts/check-approval-outcome-direction.py --base-ref origin/feature/x
python3 scripts/check-approval-outcome-direction.py --base-rev 2fe42f1b3
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -p 'test_*.py' -v          # self-tests
```

Exit status 0 means pass, 1 means a rule violation, and 2 means bad input. The
`Approval Outcome Direction` job in `pr_validation.yml` runs the self-tests and
the check against the base of each pull request.

### Authorizer Differential

Authorization PRs 6a to 6c ran `ToolAuthorizerDifferentialTests` in CI. It
compared the old gate with `ToolAuthorizer` on the catalog and on shell and
tool corpora. PR 6d deleted the old gate, so the in-CI differential has no
reference side. The corpus differential below compares the production path
with `dev` and is the proof for each later slice.

### Authorization Corpus Differential

`scripts/authorization-corpus/run.py` runs a large corpus of tool calls through
the production authorization path of two revisions and compares each decision.
Use it for each slice that moves authorization code. Zero differences against
`dev` is the proof that a refactor keeps every decision.

```bash
python3 scripts/authorization-corpus/run.py --base upstream/dev                 # HEAD against dev
python3 scripts/authorization-corpus/run.py --base upstream/dev --quick         # 3 states, a few minutes
python3 scripts/authorization-corpus/run.py --base upstream/dev --jobs 1        # one decision lane
python3 scripts/authorization-corpus/run.py --base upstream/dev --head-adapter authorizer
python3 scripts/authorization-corpus/run.py --base upstream/dev --keep          # keep the head output and worktrees
python3 scripts/authorization-corpus/run.py --base REV --head REV --fresh-head  # two probes of one revision
```

How it works:

1. The script builds the corpus from every string literal in
   `src/Netclaw.Actors.Tests` and `src/Netclaw.Security.Tests` at a fixed
   revision (`--corpus-revision`, default `4244eaed5`), plus
   `extra-commands.txt`. Each literal also runs after four compound prefixes
   (`cd` lists, an external directory, and the temporary root). The default
   corpus has 55,004 shell inputs.
2. For each revision, the script makes a disposable `git worktree`, copies the
   probe (`probe/AuthorizationCorpusProbe.cs`) and one adapter into
   `Netclaw.Actors.Tests`, builds, and runs the probe. The `gate` adapter reads
   `EvaluateAuthorizationResultAsync` (revisions up to authorization PR 6c).
   The `authorizer` adapter reads `ToolAuthorizer`. `auto` picks the
   production path of the revision.
3. The probe evaluates 21 shell states (Bash: 3 grant states, interactive or
   unattended, Approval or Auto; Bash 5.2: 5 Approval states, see below;
   PowerShell 7: 2 grant states, Approval or Auto) and 24 tool states (3 audiences, interactive or unattended, 4 consent modes)
   with the 62 tool inputs of the differential test. After a consent request,
   it also evaluates the retry with a "Once" answer. After a tool consent
   request, it records a chat grant and evaluates the call again. The probe
   decides the shell inputs in parallel lanes (see "Parallel lanes" below).
4. The script compares the two outputs and writes a report with the outcome
   transitions and the first differences.

Each line holds the outcome, reason, advice, consent request, matched grants,
coverage trace, store lookups, and the analysis that the process may execute.
The probe replaces run-specific paths with placeholders (`{P}`, `{S}`, `{X}`,
`{R}`, `{T}`, `{REPOSITORY}`, and the GUID of the fake Windows root). It also
replaces the GUID in the `netclaw-approval-matrix-<GUID>` harness folder and
in the `netclaw-testrun-<GUID>` temporary folder of the test process with
`{GUID}`. A `..` path or a basename can show these names. Grant timestamps
compare by presence only.

A `..` path can also reach the folders above the test process temporary root.
These folders hold the revision hash (the first 12 characters), so they differ
for each revision. The probe replaces the revision folder name with
`{REVISION}`, also when a basename shows it alone. The probe fails when the
folder name of `NETCLAW_CORPUS_REPOSITORY` is not a 12-character hash. The
compare step then replaces the paths with fixed tokens before it compares two
lines:

| Text in the line | Token |
|------------------|-------|
| `<out>/worktrees/{REVISION}` (the revision worktree root) | `{REVISION_ROOT}` |
| `<out>/run/{REVISION}` (the parent of the private temporary root) | `{RUN_ROOT}` |
| `<out>` (the work directory) | `{WORK_ROOT}` |

Two revisions with the same behavior therefore give the same lines. The
report shows the tokens, never a revision hash.

Bash 5.2 states:

- The `bash` states use a Bash host with no proved version, so the parser
  state is `Unknown`. A production daemon on Bash 5.2 or 5.3 has the fresh
  no-startup state. Only that state gives literal twins (F1) and the complete
  launch environment (F3).
- The `bash52` states use the Bash 5.2 host: no grant, a grant for anywhere, a
  folder grant in the project, and a chat grant, each interactive, plus an
  unattended folder grant. Use them for a change to twins, assignments, or
  launch facts:

```bash
python3 scripts/authorization-corpus/run.py --base upstream/dev \
  --states bash52-none-i-approval,bash52-anywhere-i-approval,bash52-project-i-approval,bash52-chat-i-approval,bash52-project-u-approval
```

Parallel lanes:

- `--jobs N` sets the number of decision lanes in the probe. The default is
  the CPU count minus 1. `--jobs 1` decides one input at a time, as before.
- The probe uses Akka.Streams: `Source.From(inputs)`, then an ordered
  `SelectAsync(N, decide)`, then one `FileIO.ToFile` sink. The ordered stage
  keeps the input order, and the file sink is the only writer of the output.
- Each lane owns one harness, with its own grant store, store lookup count,
  and folders. A lane decides one input at a time. A shell decision reads only
  its own input and the fixed state of the harness, so the lane count does not
  change a line.
- A tool state stays in one lane. Its chat grants stay in the harness for the
  next inputs, so the input order changes the result.
- The probe fails when a decision fails, when the sink reports an error, when
  the element count is not the input count, or when the sink did not write
  every byte. The script keeps a failed output as `.partial` and never reuses
  it.
- The output for one revision is the same, byte for byte, for each lane
  count. The parallelism is therefore not part of the output name.
- The script prints the line count and the current state every minute.
- On an 8-core machine that also ran other jobs, the probe for one revision
  took 84 minutes with one lane and 25 minutes with 7 lanes. The output was
  byte-identical.

Caution: the probe runs with a private temporary root (`TMPDIR`, `TMP`, and
`TEMP` point into the work directory). The corpus replaces the literal `/tmp`
with that root (`{T}`). A decision therefore never reads the shared `/tmp`,
which other processes change during a run.

Notes:

- The script tests committed revisions only. Commit the work before a run.
- The work directory is `artifacts/authorization-corpus` (`--out` changes it).
  The script reuses an output when the `src/` tree, adapter, probe, corpus,
  and states are the same. A full output (a `src-*.tsv` file) is about
  650 MB. A `--quick` output is about 90 MB.
- The report (`report-*.txt` in the work directory) is the durable output.
  Unless `--keep` is set, the script deletes the head output after the
  compare. It also deletes each worktree with its build output (`bin` and
  `obj`) and a failed probe's `.partial` output. The `.log` file stays.
- The base output is the cache. It stays in the work directory, so the next
  run against the same base skips the build and the probe for the base. A
  self-compare (same `src/` tree on both sides) keeps its one output for the
  same reason. The script prints the number and size of the cached outputs.
  Each new base adds one output, so delete old ones, or run with
  `--prune-cache` to delete every output except the current base output.
- `--fresh-head` probes the head again even when an output exists, and writes
  it to its own file. With the same revision for `--base` and `--head`, zero
  differences shows that two probes of one revision agree.
- Before a full run, check `df -h /` and `uptime`. A full run holds the base
  output (650 MB), the head output (650 MB), and one worktree with its build
  output at a time. Other jobs on the machine slow the build and the probe.
- Each run records its own speed. The script prints a timing block and writes
  it into the report, before the examples. This block comes from a `--quick`
  self-compare on 8 CPUs, with a load average near 90 from other jobs:

```text
timing:
  lanes: 7
  cpus: 8
  load average at the end (1 min): 90.9
  corpus: 0m 10s (10 s)
  build base: 8m 38s (518 s)
  probe base: 23m 16s (1396 s)
  build head: 4m 33s (273 s)
  probe head: 21m 28s (1288 s)
  compare: 0m 45s (45 s)
  total: 59m 04s (3544 s)
```

  A phase that reuses a cached output shows `cache hit (not run)`.
- Bash states need POSIX filesystem semantics. On Windows, the probe runs the
  PowerShell and tool states only.
- Exit status 0 means no difference. Exit status 1 means at least one
  difference. A slice with an intended change (for example PR 6e) lists each
  transition from the report.

### Authorization Metrics

`scripts/authorization-metrics.py` reports production lines and declared types
for the tool authorization path in 11 groups. Each group has a file list and
globs for the planned `src/Netclaw.{Actors,Security}/Authorization/` folders.
The script skips listed files that do not exist and reports them. It never
counts test projects. It also reports the total of all production `.cs` files
under `src/`. Code that moves out of the groups to an unlisted path stays in that
total, so read the group delta together with the whole-tree delta. `--compare`
prints a warning for each listed file that is missing at either revision.

```bash
python3 scripts/authorization-metrics.py                          # working tree
python3 scripts/authorization-metrics.py --rev 2fe42f1b3          # one revision, no checkout
python3 scripts/authorization-metrics.py --compare origin/dev HEAD
python3 scripts/authorization-metrics.py --rev HEAD --files       # list each file
```

The baseline at `2fe42f1b3` is 23,873 lines and 257 types in 67 files. The
whole production tree at that revision is 192,146 lines and 2,410 types in 909
files.

## Interactive CLI Smoke Tests (Tape Harness)

The native smoke harness exercises the interactive Termina TUI surface
that the non-interactive scenarios cannot reach (Spectre-style prompts,
wizard flows, model/provider/webhook TUIs). It drives the **real native
binary** — no Docker. Tape bodies live at `tests/smoke/tapes/<name>.tape`;
sibling assertion scripts at `tests/smoke/assertions/<name>.sh` validate
the artefacts each tape produced. The same `run-smoke.sh` entrypoint runs
in CI (`smoke.yml`) and locally — agents working on
TUI code SHOULD run the harness before declaring a change done.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `./scripts/smoke/run-smoke.sh light` | PR-gating subset: all flow tapes + non-interactive scenarios |
| `./scripts/smoke/run-smoke.sh full` | Full suite (placeholder: identical to light until backfilled) |
| `./scripts/smoke/run-smoke.sh <name>` | Single tape or scenario, e.g. `init-wizard` (fastest inner loop) |
| `./scripts/smoke/run-smoke.sh skill-sync` | Live daemon and RFC feed proof for immediate skill updates |
| `./scripts/smoke/run-smoke.sh config-retention` | Native retention editor: first key, Backspace, paste, save, and re-entry |
| `./scripts/smoke/run-smoke.sh screenshots` | Screenshot regression: capture + byte-compare against baselines |
| `./scripts/smoke/install-vhs.sh` | Idempotent VHS install (Linux/x86_64 + macOS via Homebrew) |

`run-smoke.sh` publishes the binary (or uses `NETCLAW_SMOKE_CLI` /
`NETCLAW_SMOKE_DAEMON` if exported), installs `vhs`, starts a native
`ollama serve`, and pulls the smoke models automatically.

Local runs with limited disk space can share one binary extraction directory across tape homes.
Set `DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR` to an absolute directory that the smoke run owns.
Remove that directory after all smoke processes exit.
For an active run, remove only completed tapes' `.net` directories after confirmation that no process uses those homes.
Retain the tape logs and session data for review.
After a tape completes, confirm that its daemon exits before you remove that tape's downloaded model cache.
Retain its config, logs, and session data.

Config-writing flow tapes (`init-wizard`, `provider-add`, `provider-rename`,
and `config-*`) must have executable semantic assertion scripts under
`tests/smoke/assertions/`. `run-native-tape.sh` fails these tapes when the
assertion is missing or non-executable.

The `skill-sync` scenario starts a mutable local RFC feed and the published
daemon. It runs `netclaw skill sync` twice and changes the feed between passes.
It checks the exact resource SHA-256, the live `/api/skills` inventory, and an
unchanged `netclaw.json` file. The scenario does not call a model.

When a tape fails, `smoke-logs/tapes/<name>/` collects: a debug GIF of the
last frame, the combined tape file, daemon logs, and the produced
`NETCLAW_HOME`. CI uploads the `smoke-logs` directory as a job artefact.

**Rerun this workflow in full, never with `--failed`.** The binary artefact
name ends with the attempt number
(`netclaw-native-binaries-linux-x64-<run-id>-1`). A partial rerun becomes
attempt 2 and looks for `...-2`, which the publish job never produced, so
`Download binary artifact` fails before a tape runs. Use
`gh run rerun <run-id>`, not `gh run rerun --failed <run-id>`.

The job installs Ollama from its release-pinned installer before it runs a
tape. A `curl: (35) Recv failure` at that step is a network failure that
reaches no test code. Confirm the failure is inside a tape before you
investigate the change under review.

**Authoring conventions are in `tests/smoke/tapes/README.md`**
— the short version: `Wait+Screen /pattern/` only (no `Sleep`), 1400×800
default surface, no `Screenshot` directives in flow tapes, pair every
non-trivial tape with an assertion script that re-validates `netclaw
doctor` and the
relevant `--json` output.

## Demo AppHost Smoke Test (Slow)

`samples/Netclaw.Demo.AppHost.IntegrationTests` is an Aspire-driven
end-to-end test that boots the demo AppHost (`samples/Netclaw.Demo.AppHost`),
waits for every resource — Mattermost container, Ollama container,
`qwen3.5:2b-q4_K_M` model, NetClaw daemon project — to reach healthy, posts a
Mattermost message via REST as the seeded test user, and asserts the
wiring routes the message through.

Opt-in by design: the test self-skips unless
`NETCLAW_RUN_DEMO_SMOKE=1` is set (same pattern as the Mattermost
integration tests). The `[Trait("Category", "SlowSmoke")]` trait is a
secondary filter for local-dev runs. A bare `dotnet test` on any CI
runner therefore reports the test as skipped, not failed. Invoke with:

```bash
NETCLAW_RUN_DEMO_SMOKE=1 \
  dotnet test samples/Netclaw.Demo.AppHost.IntegrationTests \
    --filter Category=SlowSmoke
```

Prerequisites: Docker daemon reachable, ~4GB of disk free on a cold
cache (Mattermost preview + Ollama image + `qwen3.5:2b-q4_K_M` weights). Warm
runs reuse cached images and the model volume.

The test's bot-reply wait is best-effort and configurable. On a
CPU-only host inference takes minutes; on GPU it's <30s. Override the
default 5-minute reply window:

```bash
NETCLAW_RUN_DEMO_SMOKE=1 \
NETCLAW_DEMO_TEST_REPLY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=900 \
  dotnet test samples/Netclaw.Demo.AppHost.IntegrationTests --filter Category=SlowSmoke
```

If the timeout elapses without a reply, the test still passes — the
structural assertions (every resource healthy, message posted into
Mattermost) prove the wiring. The latency is printed to stdout so a CI
run can flag a slow-inference regression.

## Install Script Smoke Test

`scripts/smoke/install-smoke.sh` and `scripts/smoke/install-smoke.ps1` are
hermetic regression tests for the installers (`scripts/install.sh` and
`scripts/install.ps1`). They need no network, no `dotnet` build, and no
running daemon — each serves a generated manifest and stand-in archives
from `localhost`.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `bash scripts/smoke/install-smoke.sh` | Smoke-test the `curl \| bash` installer (Linux/macOS) |
| `pwsh scripts/smoke/install-smoke.ps1` | Smoke-test the PowerShell installer (Windows) |

`install-smoke.sh` covers two layers:

- **Detection matrix** — runs `install.sh --dry-run` under `uname`/`sysctl`
  shims to assert every supported OS/arch resolves to the right RID
  (`linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `osx-arm64`) and that Intel Macs and
  unsupported OSes are rejected cleanly. This runs identically on any host.
- **Mechanical check** — one real install of a stand-in archive on the
  host's native RID, exercising download → checksum → `tar` extract → `cp`.

`install-smoke.ps1` is the Windows counterpart: a `-DryRun` resolution
check plus a real stand-in install exercising download → checksum →
`Expand-Archive` → copy.

The `install-smoke` job in `pr_validation.yml` runs these on
`ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, and `windows-latest` on every PR. Both
installers also support `--dry-run` / `-DryRun` on their own — they report
which binary *would* be installed for the current platform without
touching the system.

## Logging Conventions

- Carry cross-cutting identity (channel/adapter, session, entity ids) as
  **structured context via `ILoggingAdapter.WithContext(...)`**, set once where
  the logger is created — not baked into each message template. Actors already
  do this (e.g. `Context.GetLogger().WithContext("Adapter", "slack")`).
- Do **not** prefix the channel/adapter into the message text
  (`slack_attachment_rejected …`). Emit a plain semantic event
  (`attachment_rejected …`); the `Adapter` context disambiguates the source.
  Prefixing double-stamps what the context already carries and forces shared
  code to take a channel-name parameter purely for logging.
- Shared/abstracted helpers that take an `ILoggingAdapter` should rely on the
  caller's enriched context rather than re-passing identity strings.
- For `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` (`ILogger<T>`) call sites, the logger
  **category** already identifies the type; prefer that (or `BeginScope`) over
  repeating the class/channel name in the message.

## Source Control and CI Signals

- `git` repository with active `dev` branch
- GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`
- Azure pipeline templates in `.azure/`

## External Integrations (Planned for MVP)

- Slack Socket Mode
  - requires bot token and app token
  - no public inbound HTTP required for base interaction
- SQLite for Akka.Persistence journal and snapshots (in-memory for tests)
- MCP servers for external tool integration (MVP requirement)
- local Ollama endpoint can be used for optional smoke tests
  - local dev host: `my-gpu-server` on Tailscale (`http://my-gpu-server:11434`)
  - preferred model: `qwen3:30b` (fallback `qwen3:14b`)

## Security-Relevant Surfaces

- Slack inbound message events (untrusted input)
- tool execution surfaces (web, file read/write, shell)
- ACL configuration and policy evaluation
- system prompt and policy files loaded from disk

## Operator Interfaces (Planned)

- CLI for onboarding/config validation, policy diagnostics, and session
  operations
- management UI (ops console) for health, session inspection, ACL editing, and
  diagnostics

## Working Assumptions

- single-process architecture during MVP
- operator-controlled host and credentials
- default-deny policy with explicit per-channel and per-sender allow rules
- required CI tests do not depend on live model providers
- `my-gpu-server` Ollama access is local-dev only and not available in CI/CD
